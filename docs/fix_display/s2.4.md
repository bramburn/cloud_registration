Sprint 2.4 Backlog: Advanced Testing, Bug Fixing & Documentation (Phase 2)

Sprint Goal: To rigorously test the enhanced E57 and LAS loading capabilities with a wider array of complex files, resolve any remaining bugs from Phase 2, finalize developer documentation, and consider adding a suite of test files to the repository for ongoing regression testing, thereby ensuring the overall stability and quality of the point cloud loading features.
1. Introduction

This document outlines the backlog items for Sprint 2.4, the final sprint of Phase 2 for the "Robust Point Cloud Loading (.e57 & .las)" project. This sprint serves as a consolidation and quality assurance phase for all features developed throughout Phase 1 and Phase 2 (Sprints 2.1-2.3). The focus is on comprehensive testing with more challenging datasets, addressing any outstanding issues, ensuring the codebase is well-documented, and establishing a baseline for future regression testing.
2. User Stories
User Story 1 (Sprint 2.4): Advanced E57 and LAS Loading Testing with Complex Files

    As a QA engineer/developer,

    I want to conduct advanced testing of E57 and LAS loading functionality using a diverse set of complex, real-world, or specifically crafted challenging point cloud files,

    So that I can uncover and address bugs related to less common file structures, larger datasets, varied E57 codecs (if more than one was implemented), or edge-case LAS PDRF uses.

        Description: This story extends the testing efforts from previous sprints (especially Sprint 1.4) by focusing on more complex scenarios. This includes testing with larger files than previously used, E57 files that might use different combinations of features (e.g., multiple data3D sections, different CompressedVectorNode configurations, or the specific codec(s) implemented in Sprint 2.1 under more stress), and LAS files that might push the boundaries of the supported PDRFs or versions.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.4.1.1: Identify and acquire (or create) a new set of test files representing more complex scenarios:

                Very large E57 and LAS files (e.g., 20 million+ points, or files that approach typical system memory limits).

                E57 files utilizing the specific codec(s) implemented in Sprint 2.1 with varied data characteristics.

                E57 files with multiple data3D scans (current implementation likely loads the first; this is to test robustness and clear failure if only first is supported).

                LAS files with a high number of VLRs (to ensure header parsing and pointDataOffset remain correct).

                LAS files with unusual scale/offset values or coordinate ranges.

            Task 2.4.1.2: Execute targeted integration and system tests using these complex files. Focus on:

                Successful loading and correct display of point data.

                Performance (loading time, memory usage â€“ observe against NFRs).

                Correctness of error handling for unsupported E57 structures or LAS features encountered in these complex files.

                Stability of the application (no crashes or hangs).

            Task 2.4.1.3: Document all test results, meticulously detailing any failures, performance issues, or unexpected behavior.

            Task 2.4.1.4: Create detailed bug reports for any new issues identified.

        References between Files:

            All parser files (src/e57parser.h/cpp, src/lasparser.h/cpp).

            Main application logic (src/mainwindow.h/cpp).

            Viewer (src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h/cpp).

            New complex test files (e.g., very_large.e57, e57_multi_scan.e57, las_many_vlrs.las).

            Test plan documents or checklists.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A defined set of advanced/complex E57 and LAS test files has been processed by the application.

            The application successfully loads and displays data from complex files that are within the (now expanded) supported scope.

            The application gracefully fails with clear error messages for complex files that contain unsupported features (e.g., an E57 with a different, unsupported codec, or an E57 with multiple scans if only the first is designed to be loaded).

            No new critical crashes or hangs are introduced when handling these complex files.

            Performance with very large files is observed and documented, noting any significant deviations from expectations (even if full optimization is later).

            Test results and any new bugs are thoroughly documented.

        Testing Plan:

            System/Stress Tests:

                Test Case 2.4.1.A: Load a very large E57 file (e.g., >20M points, using implemented codec if applicable).

                    Test Data: very_large_e57_codec1_20M.e57.

                    Expected Result: File loads successfully (perhaps slowly, but without crashing). Points are displayed. Memory usage is monitored.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing, system performance monitors.

                Test Case 2.4.1.B: Load a very large LAS file (e.g., >20M points).

                    Test Data: very_large_las_pdrf1_20M.las.

                    Expected Result: File loads successfully. Points are displayed. Memory usage and loading time are monitored.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing, system performance monitors.

                Test Case 2.4.1.C: Attempt to load an E57 file with multiple data3D scan sections.

                    Test Data: e57_multi_scan.e57.

                    Expected Result: Application either loads the first scan successfully and informs the user, or gracefully indicates that only the first scan is supported (if that's the design). It should not crash.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

                Test Case 2.4.1.D: Load LAS files with unusual (but valid) header values (e.g., extreme scale/offsets, large number of VLRs).

                    Test Data: las_extreme_coords.las, las_many_vlrs.las.

                    Expected Result: Files load correctly if the point data itself is valid and within PDRF 0-3 scope.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

User Story 2 (Sprint 2.4): Final Bug Fixing and Stability Hardening (Phase 2)

    As a developer,

    I want to address and resolve all remaining critical and high-priority bugs identified during Phase 2 testing (Sprints 2.1-2.3 and User Story 1 of this sprint),

    So that the overall point cloud loading functionality is stable, reliable, and meets all defined requirements for Phase 1 and Phase 2.

        Description: This story is dedicated to fixing any bugs that have been logged throughout Phase 2, including those from advanced testing in the previous user story. The goal is to achieve a high level of stability and correctness for all implemented features.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.4.2.1: Consolidate and prioritize all outstanding bug reports from Phase 2.

            Task 2.4.2.2: For each prioritized bug:

                Perform root cause analysis.

                Implement code fixes in the relevant modules (E57Parser, LasParser, MainWindow, PointCloudViewerWidget, UI feedback elements).

                Add specific unit tests to cover the fixed bug scenario, preventing regressions.

                Conduct developer testing to confirm the fix.

            Task 2.4.2.3: Perform targeted regression testing around the areas of the fixes.

            Task 2.4.2.4: Update the bug tracking system, marking bugs as resolved and verified.

            Task 2.4.2.5: Conduct a final round of general smoke testing on the main loading paths with key test files.

        References between Files:

            Any files identified as containing bugs during Phase 2 testing.

            Corresponding header files.

            tests/test_e57parser.cpp, tests/test_lasparser.cpp (for adding new regression tests).

            Bug tracking system.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            All critical and high-priority bugs logged during Phase 2 (Sprints 2.1-2.4) related to E57/LAS loading, performance, and UI feedback are fixed, verified, and closed.

            Regression tests for all fixed bugs pass.

            The application demonstrates stable behavior across the range of test files and scenarios defined for Phase 1 and Phase 2.

            No new critical regressions are introduced by the bug fixes.

        Testing Plan:

            Bug Verification Testing: For each bug fixed, re-run the specific test case(s) that initially identified the bug.

            Targeted Regression Testing: After a bug fix, run a small set of related tests to ensure no unintended side effects.

            Smoke Testing: Perform a quick run-through of the main use cases (load valid E57, load valid LAS, attempt to load an invalid file of each type) to ensure basic functionality is intact.

                Test Data: A small core set of representative valid and invalid files.

                Expected Result: Application behaves as expected for these core scenarios.

                Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

User Story 3 (Sprint 2.4): Finalize Developer Documentation and Consider Test Suite Integration

    As a development team member,

    I want to complete all developer documentation (code comments, internal design notes) for the E57 and LAS parsing modules and consider adding a core suite of test files to the repository,

    So that the codebase is easily maintainable, future development is supported, and ongoing regression testing is facilitated.

        Description: This story wraps up the documentation efforts for all the parsing logic developed. It also includes an action to evaluate and potentially integrate a small, representative set of E57 and LAS test files directly into the project's version control. This helps in CI/CD pipelines and makes it easier for developers to run regression tests locally.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.4.3.1: Review and finalize all Doxygen-style (or project standard) code comments in E57Parser.h/cpp and LasParser.h/cpp. Ensure all public APIs, complex algorithms (like codec handling, performance optimizations), and important data structures are clearly documented.

            Task 2.4.3.2: Update any internal design documents, README sections, or wiki pages related to the point cloud loading module to reflect the final state of Phase 2 development (including supported codecs, performance characteristics, UI feedback mechanisms).

            Task 2.4.3.3: Evaluate the feasibility and benefits of adding a small, curated set of E57 and LAS test files (both valid and intentionally invalid ones that trigger specific error paths) to the project's repository (e.g., in a tests/data/ directory).

                Consider file sizes to avoid bloating the repository.

                Ensure these files have clear naming conventions indicating their purpose.

            Task 2.4.3.4: If deemed beneficial (Task 2.4.3.3), select and add these core test files to version control.

            Task 2.4.3.5: Update any automated test scripts or CMakeLists.txt (or equivalent build system files) if necessary to locate and use these in-repository test files for unit/integration tests.

        References between Files:

            src/e57parser.h/cpp

            src/lasparser.h/cpp

            Existing developer documentation, READMEs, wikis.

            tests/CMakeLists.txt or build scripts (if test files are integrated).

            New directory for test data (e.g., tests/data/).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Code comments in E57Parser and LasParser are comprehensive and up-to-date.

            Internal developer documentation accurately reflects the capabilities and design of the point cloud loading module after Phase 2.

            A decision on integrating a core suite of test files into the repository is made and, if affirmative, implemented.

            If test files are integrated, unit/integration tests can successfully locate and use them.

        Testing Plan:

            Not directly testable via execution for documentation.

            Verification:

                Peer review of code comments and updated documentation.

                Confirmation that if test files are added to the repo, they are accessible and usable by test scripts/build system.

                Successful execution of automated tests that might now rely on these in-repository files.
