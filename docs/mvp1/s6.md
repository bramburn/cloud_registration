Sprint 6 Backlog: Export & Quality Features
Sprint Goal: To finalize the registration workflow by implementing comprehensive data export capabilities and professional-grade quality assessment tools, allowing users to save their work for use in other applications and to generate detailed reports for documentation and verification.

Introduction
This document provides an atomic breakdown of the tasks for Sprint 6. With the core alignment algorithms from previous sprints now complete, this sprint focuses on the final, crucial steps of the workflow: getting data out of the application and formally validating its quality. This involves creating a flexible export engine supporting multiple industry-standard file formats, and building a robust quality analysis system that can generate professional, shareable reports. This sprint will transform the application into a complete, end-to-end registration solution.

User Stories
User Story 1: Multi-Format Point Cloud Export

Description: As a surveyor, once I have completed a registration, I need to export the aligned point cloud into various industry-standard formats (like E57, LAS, PLY, and simple XYZ). This is critical for integrating my results with other CAD or GIS software packages and for delivering the final data to my clients in a format they can use.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create IFormatWriter Abstract Base Class:

Create a new file: src/export/IFormatWriter.h.

Define an abstract class IFormatWriter with pure virtual methods: bool open(const QString& path), bool writeHeader(const HeaderInfo& info), bool writePoint(const Point& p), and bool close().

Implement E57Writer:

Create new files: src/export/FormatWriters/E57Writer.h and src/export/FormatWriters/E57Writer.cpp.

The class will inherit from IFormatWriter.

Implement the open, writeHeader, writePoint, and close methods specifically for the E57 format using the libE57Format library. The writeHeader method must set up the correct XML structure for a new E57 file.

Implement LASWriter:

Create new files: src/export/FormatWriters/LASWriter.h and src/export/FormatWriters/LASWriter.cpp.

Inherit from IFormatWriter.

Implement the methods to write a valid LAS 1.2 file format. This includes writing the public header block with correct point counts and bounding boxes, and then writing each point as a fixed-size point data record.

Implement PLYWriter and XYZWriter:

Create corresponding classes and files for PLY and XYZ formats, inheriting from IFormatWriter. The XYZWriter will be a simple text writer that outputs "X Y Z" coordinates on each line. The PLYWriter will write the ASCII PLY header followed by the list of vertices.

Create Master PointCloudExporter Engine:

Create new files: src/export/PointCloudExporter.h and src/export/PointCloudExporter.cpp.

This class will take the point cloud data and export options as input. Based on the selected format, it will instantiate the correct IFormatWriter (e.g., E57Writer) and use it to write the file.

Create ExportDialog UI:

Create new files: src/ui/ExportDialog.h and src/ui/ExportDialog.cpp.

This QDialog will contain a QComboBox to select the file format (E57, LAS, etc.), checkboxes to include/exclude attributes like color and intensity, and a file path selector.

Clicking "Export" on this dialog will trigger the PointCloudExporter engine.

References between Files:

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will have an "Export" button that opens the ExportDialog.

ExportDialog will provide configuration options to the PointCloudExporter.

PointCloudExporter will use a specific IFormatWriter implementation (E57Writer, LASWriter, etc.) to perform the file writing.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user can successfully export a registered point cloud to E57, LAS, PLY, and XYZ formats.

The exported files must be readable by at least one other common third-party software (e.g., CloudCompare).

The transformation applied during registration must be correctly "baked" into the coordinates of the exported points.

The export process for a 50 million point cloud must complete in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., under 5 minutes).

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: Round-Trip Format Validation.

Test Data: A simple, known point cloud (e.g., a 10x10x10 cube).

Expected Result: Export the data to each supported format (E57, LAS). Then, re-import the exported file back into the application. The re-imported point cloud must be identical to the original, with no loss of precision.

Testing Tool: Manual application testing and file comparison tools.

User Story 2: Registration Quality Assessment and Reporting

Description: As a project manager, I need to generate a formal quality report after a registration is complete. This report must contain key accuracy metrics, statistics, and visualizations, which I can use to validate the quality of the work and include in the final project documentation for the client.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create QualityAssessment Engine:

Create new files: src/quality/QualityAssessment.h and src/quality/QualityAssessment.cpp.

This class will contain methods to perform various quality checks.

Implement Statistical Analysis Methods:

Add a method to QualityAssessment: calculateErrorMetrics(const QList<Correspondence>& correspondences). This method will calculate and return a struct containing the RMS error, mean error, standard deviation, and maximum error.

Add another method: calculateOverlapPercentage(const PointCloud& cloud1, const PointCloud& cloud2, float tolerance). This will estimate the percentage of overlap between the two clouds.

Create ReportGenerator Class:

Create new files: src/reporting/ReportGenerator.h and src/reporting/ReportGenerator.cpp.

Implement a method void generatePdfReport(const ReportData& data, const QString& outputPath).

Implement PDF Generation Logic:

Inside generatePdfReport, use Qt's QPdfWriter and QPainter.

Add methods to draw specific sections: drawHeader(QPainter& p, ...) to add the project name and date; drawMetricsTable(QPainter& p, ...) to draw a table of the quality metrics; drawImage(QPainter& p, ...) to insert screenshots.

Create QualityDashboard UI Panel:

Create new files: src/ui/QualityDashboard.h and src/ui/QualityDashboard.cpp.

This QWidget will be the final step in the registration workflow.

Add QLabels to display the final RMS error and estimated overlap percentage.

Add a QPushButton labeled "Generate PDF Report".

References between Files:

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will display the QualityDashboard as the final step.

QualityDashboard will get its data from the QualityAssessment engine.

The "Generate PDF Report" button on the QualityDashboard will invoke the ReportGenerator.

Acceptance Criteria:

A PDF report is successfully generated and saved to the user's chosen location.

The PDF report accurately contains the project name, date, and key quality metrics (RMS error, overlap).

The report includes at least one screenshot of the final registered point cloud.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: Report Content Validation.

Test Data: A completed registration with a known RMS error of 1.5mm.

Expected Result: Generate a PDF report. Open the PDF and manually verify that the RMS error printed in the report is exactly "1.5mm" and that the project name and other data are correct.

Testing Tool: Manual testing and inspection of the output PDF file.

User Story 3: Coordinate System Management and Transformation

Description: As a GIS specialist, I need the ability to define a coordinate reference system (CRS) for my project and transform the point cloud data to a different CRS upon export. This is essential for ensuring my registered data can be correctly integrated into larger geospatial datasets and GIS projects.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create CoordinateSystemManager Class:

Create new files: src/coordinates/CoordinateSystemManager.h and src/coordinates/CoordinateSystemManager.cpp.

In this class, create a hardcoded list of common coordinate systems (e.g., WGS84, UTM Zone 10N, State Plane). Each entry should store its name and EPSG code.

Implement a method QList<CRSInfo> getAvailableSystems() that returns this list.

Create TransformationEngine Class:

Create new files: src/coordinates/TransformationEngine.h and src/coordinates/TransformationEngine.cpp.

Implement a method: PointCloud transform(const PointCloud& pc, const QString& fromEpsg, const QString& toEpsg).

Inside this method, implement the mathematical formulas for a simple transformation (e.g., WGS84 Latitude/Longitude to a basic Mercator projection) as a proof of concept. Note: Do not use an external library like Proj4 for this atomic task. Manually implement the specific formula.

Integrate into Export UI:

In the ExportDialog UI created in User Story 1, add two QComboBox widgets: "Source CRS" and "Target CRS".

Populate both dropdowns with the list of systems from the CoordinateSystemManager.

Integrate into Export Logic:

In the PointCloudExporter, before writing the data, check if the source and target CRS in the export options are different.

If they are different, call the TransformationEngine::transform method to get a new, transformed point cloud.

Pass this transformed point cloud to the appropriate IFormatWriter, instead of the original.

References between Files:

ExportDialog will use CoordinateSystemManager to populate its dropdowns.

PointCloudExporter will use TransformationEngine to perform the data transformation.

Acceptance Criteria:

The ExportDialog correctly shows dropdowns for source and target coordinate systems.

Exporting a point cloud from WGS84 to a target CRS results in an output file where the point coordinates are different from the original and consistent with the expected transformation.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 3.1: Coordinate Transformation Verification.

Test Data: A single point with known WGS84 coordinates (e.g., lat: 51.5074, lon: -0.1278 for London).

Expected Result: Export this single point, transforming it to a target CRS (e.g., UTM Zone 30N). Open the output file (e.g., an XYZ text file) and verify that the coordinates match the known, correct UTM coordinates for that location (approx. X: 699436, Y: 5710143).

Testing Tool: Manual testing and verification using an online coordinate conversion tool.
