- ✅ Point Cloud Processing (voxel grid filtering)
- ✅ Performance Profiling system
- ✅ Comprehensive Testing Framework
- ✅ Decoupled Architecture (MVP pattern with interfaces)

### MVP Gaps (To Be Implemented)
- ❌ 3D Point Cloud Visualization (Qt OpenGL viewer)
- ❌ Registration Workflow UI
- ❌ Target Detection & Selection (spheres, checkerboards, natural points)
- ❌ Manual Alignment with 3+ corresponding points
- ❌ Cloud-to-Cloud Registration (ICP algorithm)
- ❌ Point Cloud Export Functionality
