Sprint 11 Backlog: Change Detection and Analysis Tools
Sprint Goal: To introduce advanced analytical capabilities into the application by implementing cloud-to-cloud change detection, cloud-to-model deviation analysis, and interactive annotation and measurement tools, enabling users to perform quality control and as-built verification workflows.

Introduction
This document provides an atomic breakdown of the tasks for Sprint 11. With the core registration and usability features now established, this sprint extends the application's functionality into the critical domain of analysis and quality assurance. The goal is to provide users with powerful tools to compare datasets, whether against another scan or a design model, and to quantify and document these comparisons. This sprint will add significant value for users in construction verification, industrial inspection, and deformation monitoring.

User Stories
User Story 1: Cloud-to-Cloud (C2C) Change Detection

Description: As a construction manager monitoring a site over time, I need to compare a new scan against a baseline scan of the same area to automatically identify and visualize what has been added or removed. This allows me to quickly track progress, verify work, and detect unexpected changes without manually inspecting the entire dataset.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create ChangeDetectionEngine Class:

Create new files: src/analysis/ChangeDetectionEngine.h and src/analysis/ChangeDetectionEngine.cpp.

In the header, declare a method: QVector<float> computeC2CDistances(const PointCloud& referenceCloud, const PointCloud& comparisonCloud).

Implement C2C Distance Calculation:

Inside the computeC2CDistances method:

Step A: Build a K-D Tree data structure from the referenceCloud's points for efficient nearest-neighbor searching.

Step B: Create an empty QVector<float> named distances and reserve space equal to the number of points in comparisonCloud.

Step C: Start a for loop that iterates through each point (p_comp) in the comparisonCloud.

Step D: Inside the loop, use the K-D Tree to find the single closest point (p_ref) in the referenceCloud to p_comp.

Step E: Calculate the 3D Euclidean distance between p_comp and p_ref.

Step F: Append this calculated distance to the distances vector.

Step G: After the loop, return the distances vector.

Modify Rendering for Change Detection:

Shader Logic: In the fragment shader (pointcloud.frag), add a new uniform int changeDetectionMode (0=off, 1=on) and uniform float changeThreshold. Add a new in float changeDistance attribute. When changeDetectionMode is 1, use the changeDistance value to set the color: if abs(changeDistance) < changeThreshold, color it grey (unchanged). If changeDistance is positive (point exists in comparison but not reference), color it green (added). If negative, color it red (removed). Note: A simple distance calculation cannot determine added/removed; this will require a more advanced signed distance calculation later. For this step, we will color based on distance magnitude. Color blue for distances < threshold, green for medium distances, red for large distances.

VBO Update: Add a new vertex attribute to the main VBO for the changeDistance. Modify the PointCloudViewerWidget to be able to load this new attribute into the buffer.

Create Change Detection UI Panel:

In RegistrationWorkflowWidget or a new dialog, add a QGroupBox for "Change Detection".

Add a QDoubleSpinBox for the user to enter the changeThreshold distance.

Add a QPushButton labeled "Run C2C Analysis".

When the button is clicked, it will: 1. Get the two scans to be compared. 2. Call ChangeDetectionEngine::computeC2CDistances. 3. Load the resulting distances into the VBO as the new vertex attribute. 4. Set the changeDetectionMode uniform on the shader to 1. 5. Trigger a repaint.

References between Files:

The UI panel will trigger a method in AlignmentEngine or a similar controller.

This controller will use the new ChangeDetectionEngine.

The PointCloudViewerWidget and its shaders will be modified to support rendering the distance data.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user can select two registered scans and run the C2C analysis.

The comparison cloud is re-colored to show a heat map of distances from the reference cloud.

Points within the user-defined distance threshold are colored grey/blue, while points with larger distances are colored red/yellow.

The analysis process is non-blocking and provides progress feedback for large clouds.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: C2C Analysis of Identical Scans.

Test Data: Two copies of the exact same, perfectly registered point cloud. Set the distance threshold to 1mm.

Expected Result: After running the analysis, the entire comparison point cloud must be rendered in the "unchanged" color (e.g., blue), as all distances should be 0.

Testing Tool: Manual visual inspection.

User Story 2: Cloud-to-Model (C2M) Deviation Analysis

Description: As a quality control engineer, I need to compare a 3D scan of a manufactured part against its original CAD model. The system must calculate the deviation at each point of the scan from the model's surface and display this as a color-coded heat map, allowing me to instantly identify areas that are out of tolerance.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Implement Simple .obj Model Importer:

Create a new class src/import/ModelImporter.h/.cpp.

Implement a method TriangleMesh importObj(const QString& filePath).

Inside this method, open the .obj file as a text file.

Read the file line by line.

If a line starts with "v ", parse the three following numbers as the X, Y, Z coordinates of a vertex and store them in a list of vertices.

If a line starts with "f ", parse the three following numbers as the indices of the vertices that form a triangle face and store them in a list of faces.

Return the populated TriangleMesh object.

Create TriangleMesh Data Structure:

In a new file src/geometry/TriangleMesh.h, define a struct TriangleMesh containing a QVector<QVector3D> vertices and a QVector<int> indices.

Implement Point-to-Mesh Distance Calculation:

In the ChangeDetectionEngine class, create a new method: QVector<float> computeC2MDistances(const PointCloud& cloud, const TriangleMesh& mesh).

Inside this method:

Step A: Build an acceleration structure for the mesh (e.g., an AABB tree of the triangles) for efficient searching.

Step B: Loop through each point p in the cloud.

Step C: For each point p, perform a search in the acceleration structure to find the closest triangle on the mesh.

Step D: Calculate the precise distance from point p to the closest point on the surface of that triangle.

Step E: Store this distance in a distances vector.

Step F: Return the distances vector.

Integrate C2M into UI:

Add a "Compare to Model..." QPushButton to the analysis UI panel.

When clicked, this button opens a file dialog for the user to select an .obj file.

On selection, the file is imported using ModelImporter.

The ChangeDetectionEngine is then called to compute the C2M distances.

The results are loaded into the VBO and rendered as a heat map, reusing the same shader logic as in User Story 1.

References between Files:

The UI will use the new ModelImporter to load CAD data.

The ChangeDetectionEngine will be extended with the computeC2MDistances method.

The PointCloudViewerWidget will be used to render the point cloud colored by the deviation results.

Acceptance Criteria:

A user can successfully import a standard .obj file as a reference model.

The system correctly computes the deviation of a scanned point cloud from the surface of the imported model.

The point cloud is colored with a heat map where blue indicates near-zero deviation and red indicates high deviation.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: C2M Deviation on a Perfect Shape.

Test Data: A synthetic point cloud of a perfect 1-meter cube, and an .obj model file of the exact same 1-meter cube.

Expected Result: After running the C2M analysis, the entire point cloud must be rendered in the "zero deviation" color (blue), as all points lie perfectly on the surface of the model.

Testing Tool: Manual visual inspection.

User Story 3: Interactive Annotation and Measurement Tools

Description: As an analyst reviewing a change detection report, I need to place text annotations on specific points of interest to document my findings. I also need a simple tool to measure the distance between any two points in the 3D scene to quantify a specific change or feature size.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Define and Store Annotation Objects:

Create a new Annotation struct in src/analysis/Annotation.h. It must contain QString id, QVector3D position, QString text, and QColor color.

Create an AnnotationManager class in new files src/analysis/AnnotationManager.h/.cpp. This class will hold a QList<Annotation>.

In the SQLiteManager, add a new table named Annotations with columns for all fields in the Annotation struct. Implement insertAnnotation, updateAnnotation, and deleteAnnotation methods.

Implement Annotation Rendering:

In PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL(), after rendering the point cloud, loop through all annotations in the AnnotationManager.

For each annotation, convert its 3D position to 2D screen coordinates.

Use QPainter to draw a small circle at the 2D screen position.

Use QPainter::drawText to render the annotation's text next to the circle.

Implement "Create Annotation" Tool Mode:

Add a new "Create Annotation" QAction to the toolbar.

When this action is toggled on, change the mouse cursor to a crosshair.

In PointCloudViewerWidget::mousePressEvent, if this mode is active, perform a point-picking operation (as in Sprint 3).

Use a QInputDialog::getText to prompt the user to enter the annotation text.

If the user enters text, create a new Annotation object with the picked point's position and the entered text. Add it to the AnnotationManager and save it to the SQLite database.

Implement Measurement Tool:

Add a "Measure Distance" QAction to the toolbar.

When this mode is active, on the first user click, pick a point and store it as m_measurementStartPoint.

On the second user click, pick a point and store it as m_measurementEndPoint.

Calculate the 3D Euclidean distance between the start and end points.

Render a temporary line between the two points in the 3D view.

Render the calculated distance as a text label at the midpoint of the line using QPainter. This measurement is temporary and is cleared when the user starts a new measurement or changes tools.

References between Files:

MainWindow will have new QActions for the annotation and measurement tools.

PointCloudViewerWidget will be modified to handle the new tool modes and to render the annotations and measurements.

AnnotationManager will be used to manage annotation data, and it will interact with SQLiteManager to persist the data.

Acceptance Criteria:

A user can enter "Create Annotation" mode, click on a point, type text, and see a persistent text label appear in the 3D view.

Annotations are saved with the project and are still present when the project is re-opened.

A user can enter "Measure Distance" mode, click on two points, and see a line drawn between them with a correct distance label.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 3.1: Annotation Persistence.

Test Data: Any loaded project.

Expected Result: 1. Create three annotations. 2. Save the project. 3. Close and reopen the project. 4. The three annotations must be visible in their original positions with the correct text.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

Conclusion
Sprint 11 marks a pivotal transition for the application, evolving it from a pure registration tool into a comprehensive analysis and verification platform. The addition of C2C and C2M comparison provides immense value for as-built verification and progress tracking workflows. The annotation and measurement tools empower users to effectively document and communicate their findings. Upon completion, the application will not only be ableto answer "Are these scans aligned?" but also "How have these scans changed?" and "Does this scan match the design model?", making it an indispensable tool for a wide range of engineering and surveying professionals.
