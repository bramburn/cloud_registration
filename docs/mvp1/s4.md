Sprint 4 Backlog: Manual Alignment Implementation
Sprint Goal: To implement the core manual registration capability, enabling users to compute and preview a precise 3D alignment transformation based on a set of user-defined correspondence points, with real-time feedback on alignment quality.

Introduction
This document provides an atomic breakdown of the tasks for Sprint 4. With the target selection systems from Sprint 3 in place, this sprint focuses on utilizing those user-created correspondences to perform the initial registration. The central task is to implement the mathematical algorithms that calculate the optimal rotation and translation to align one point cloud with another. This will be coupled with a real-time preview system, allowing users to instantly visualize the result of their selections, and a quality assessment engine to provide quantitative feedback on the alignment's accuracy.

User Stories
User Story 1: Manual Alignment from Correspondences

Description: As a surveyor, after I have identified at least three pairs of corresponding points between two scans, I need the software to calculate the rigid body transformation (rotation and translation) that best aligns these point pairs. This is the fundamental calculation that allows me to merge two separate scans into a single, cohesive model.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create LeastSquaresAlignment Class:

Create new files: src/algorithms/LeastSquaresAlignment.h and src/algorithms/LeastSquaresAlignment.cpp.

In the header, declare a method TransformationMatrix computeTransformation(const QList<QPair<QVector3D, QVector3D>>& correspondences). The input is a list of pairs, where each pair contains a point from the source scan and the corresponding point from the target scan.

Implement Centroid Calculation:

Inside computeTransformation, calculate the centroid (average position) of the source points.

Calculate the centroid of the target points.

Implement Covariance Matrix Calculation:

Subtract the respective centroids from each source and target point to create centered point sets.

Compute the 3x3 covariance matrix H by summing the outer product of the centered source points and centered target points for all correspondence pairs. H = sum(centered_source_i * centered_target_i^T).

Implement Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):

Use the Eigen library to perform SVD on the covariance matrix H. This will decompose H into three matrices: U, S, and V. H = U * S * V^T.

Calculate Rotation Matrix:

Calculate the optimal rotation matrix R using the formula R = V * U^T.

Check for a special reflection case: if det(R) is -1, you must correct the rotation by negating the last column of V and recalculating R.

Calculate Translation Vector:

Calculate the optimal translation vector t using the formula t = centroid_target - R * centroid_source.

Assemble and Return Transformation Matrix:

Create a 4x4 TransformationMatrix object.

Populate the top-left 3x3 part with the rotation matrix R.

Populate the top-right 3x1 part with the translation vector t.

The bottom row should be [0, 0, 0, 1].

Return the final transformation matrix.

References between Files:

AlignmentEngine (to be created) will call LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation.

The LeastSquaresAlignment class will depend on the Eigen library for matrix operations (SVD).

Acceptance Criteria:

Given exactly 3 non-collinear correspondence pairs, the method computes a valid transformation matrix.

The computed transformation, when applied to the source points, aligns them perfectly with the target points (within floating-point precision).

Given more than 3 correspondence pairs, the method computes a least-squares best-fit transformation.

The implementation correctly handles the reflection case by checking the determinant of the rotation matrix.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: Perfect Alignment with 3 Points.

Test Data: Create a source set of 3 points (e.g., forming a triangle). Create a target set by applying a known rotation and translation to the source points.

Expected Result: The computeTransformation method must return a matrix that is identical (within a small tolerance) to the known transformation that was applied.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for LeastSquaresAlignment.

Test Case 1.2: Least-Squares Alignment with Noise.

Test Data: Create 10 source points. Create 10 target points by applying a known transformation and then adding a small amount of random noise to each target point's coordinates.

Expected Result: The computed transformation should be a close approximation of the known transformation. The sum of squared distances between the transformed source points and the noisy target points should be minimized.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for LeastSquaresAlignment.

User Story 2: Real-time Transformation Preview

Description: As a user, when I define or modify the correspondence points, I want to see one of the point clouds instantly move to its new aligned position in the 3D viewer. This immediate visual feedback is crucial for me to understand the impact of my point selections and to iteratively refine the alignment until it looks correct.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create AlignmentEngine Class:

Create new files: src/registration/AlignmentEngine.h and src/registration/AlignmentEngine.cpp.

This class will orchestrate the alignment process. It will hold the list of correspondences.

Create a method void recomputeAlignment() that calls LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation and stores the resulting matrix.

After computing, it must emit a signal transformationUpdated(const TransformationMatrix& newTransform).

Modify PointCloudViewerWidget for Dynamic Transformation:

Add a new QMatrix4x4 m_dynamicTransform member variable to PointCloudViewerWidget.

Create a public slot void setDynamicTransform(const QMatrix4x4& transform).

In the paintGL method, when preparing the MVP matrix, modify it to mvpMatrix = projection * view * dynamicTransform * model.

Connect Engine to Viewer:

In the RegistrationWorkflowWidget, connect the AlignmentEngine::transformationUpdated signal to the PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform slot of the "movable" scan view (e.g., the right-hand viewer).

Every time the user adds, removes, or modifies a correspondence pair in the TargetManager, call the AlignmentEngine::recomputeAlignment() method.

References between Files:

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will own the AlignmentEngine.

AlignmentEngine will use LeastSquaresAlignment.

AlignmentEngine will signal the PointCloudViewerWidget to update its view.

Acceptance Criteria:

After the third correspondence pair is defined, the source point cloud visually snaps into its new aligned position.

Adding a fourth (or more) correspondence point causes the source cloud's position to update in real-time (<200ms delay).

Removing a correspondence point also triggers a real-time update of the preview.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: Real-time Update Speed.

Test Data: Two loaded scans with at least 1 million points each.

Expected Result: After establishing 3 correspondences, add a 4th. The time between the user action (the click) and the visual update of the point cloud in the viewer must be less than 200 milliseconds.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing with a stopwatch or integrated performance profiler.

User Story 3: Alignment Quality Assessment

Description: As a project manager, I need to see quantitative feedback on the quality of the manual alignment. Specifically, I want to know the Root Mean Square (RMS) error of the alignment so I can judge whether the selected correspondence points are accurate and reliable enough to proceed to the next stage.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create ErrorAnalysis Class:

Create new files: src/registration/ErrorAnalysis.h and src/registration/ErrorAnalysis.cpp.

Create a method float calculateRMSError(const QList<QPair<QVector3D, QVector3D>>& correspondences, const TransformationMatrix& transform).

Implement RMS Error Calculation:

Inside calculateRMSError, initialize a sumOfSquares variable to 0.0.

Loop through each correspondence pair.

For each pair, apply the transform to the source point.

Calculate the Euclidean distance between the transformed source point and the target point.

Square this distance and add it to sumOfSquares.

After the loop, calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by dividing sumOfSquares by the number of correspondences.

Return the square root of the MSE.

Integrate with AlignmentEngine:

After the AlignmentEngine computes a new transformation in recomputeAlignment(), it must immediately call ErrorAnalysis::calculateRMSError.

The AlignmentEngine will then emit a new signal, qualityMetricsUpdated(float rmsError).

Display RMS Error in UI:

Add a QLabel to the RegistrationWorkflowWidget or a dedicated status panel.

Connect the AlignmentEngine::qualityMetricsUpdated signal to a slot that updates the QLabel's text to display the RMS error (e.g., "RMS Error: 0.8mm").

References between Files:

AlignmentEngine will use the ErrorAnalysis class.

AlignmentEngine will signal the main UI (RegistrationWorkflowWidget) to update the quality display.

Acceptance Criteria:

An RMS error value is displayed in the UI and updates in real-time whenever the alignment changes.

For a perfect alignment (no noise), the displayed RMS error is 0.0 (or very close to it).

If the user selects an incorrect correspondence point, the RMS error value visibly increases.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 3.1: RMS Error Calculation Correctness.

Test Data: A set of 4 source points. A set of 4 target points created by applying a known transformation to the source points. Manually change one target point's position by a known distance (e.g., 5mm).

Expected Result: The calculated RMS error should match the expected value based on the one displaced point. (e.g., for one point moved 5mm out of 4 total, RMS = sqrt((0^2+0^2+0^2+5^2)/4) = 2.5mm).

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for ErrorAnalysis.

Conclusion
Sprint 4 delivers the first interactive registration capability to the user. By its completion, the core logic for calculating and previewing transformations will be in place, supported by essential quality feedback mechanisms. This sprint transforms the application from a passive viewer into an active alignment tool. It perfectly sets the stage for Sprint 5, where the results of this manual alignment will be used as the crucial starting point for the automated ICP (Iterative Closest Point) refinement algorithm.
