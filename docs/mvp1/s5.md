Sprint 5 Backlog: Cloud-to-Cloud Registration (ICP)
Sprint Goal: To implement the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, providing an automated method to finely tune and improve the accuracy of the initial manual alignment created in the previous sprint.

Introduction
This document provides an atomic breakdown of the tasks for Sprint 5. Now that a coarse manual alignment can be achieved, this sprint will introduce the first major automated registration algorithm: Iterative Closest Point (ICP). This is a critical feature that elevates the tool's precision to a professional grade. The work involves implementing the core ICP algorithm, adding more advanced algorithmic variants for robustness, and providing essential real-time feedback to the user as the computation runs.

User Stories
User Story 1: Point-to-Point ICP Implementation

Description: As a surveyor, after completing a rough manual alignment, I need the software to automatically refine this alignment by using the full point cloud data. This ICP process should minimize the distance between all corresponding points, resulting in a highly accurate, optimized registration that would be impossible to achieve by hand.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create ICPRegistration Class:

Create new files: src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.h and src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.cpp.

In the header, define the ICPRegistration class.

Declare a public method: TransformationMatrix compute(const PointCloud& source, const PointCloud& target, const TransformationMatrix& initialGuess, const ICPParams& params).

Implement Main ICP Loop:

Inside the compute method, create a copy of the source point cloud, let's call it movableSource.

Initialize the current best transformation with initialGuess.

Start a for loop that iterates from 0 up to params.maxIterations.

Sub-task 1: Find Correspondences (Inside Loop):

For each single point in movableSource, perform a nearest-neighbor search to find the one single closest point in the target point cloud.

To do this efficiently, first build a K-D Tree data structure from the target point cloud's points.

Store these found pairs of points (one from movableSource, one from target) in a list of correspondences.

Sub-task 2: Compute Transformation (Inside Loop):

Pass the list of correspondence pairs to the LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation method (from Sprint 4).

This will return a small, incremental transformation matrix for the current iteration.

Sub-task 3: Apply Transformation (Inside Loop):

Apply this new incremental transformation to every point in the movableSource point cloud.

Update the overall best transformation by composing it with the incremental one.

Sub-task 4: Check for Convergence (Inside Loop):

Calculate the Root Mean Square (RMS) error for the current set of correspondences using the ErrorAnalysis class (from Sprint 4).

Compare the current RMS error to the RMS error from the previous iteration.

If the absolute difference between them is less than params.convergenceThreshold, break the for loop.

Store the current RMS error for the next iteration's comparison.

Return Final Transformation:

After the loop finishes (either by reaching max iterations or by converging), return the final, overall best transformation matrix.

References between Files:

AlignmentEngine (from Sprint 4) will be modified to call ICPRegistration::compute.

ICPRegistration will use LeastSquaresAlignment to calculate the transformation at each step.

ICPRegistration will require an efficient spatial search structure (like a K-D Tree or the existing Octree) to find nearest neighbors.

Acceptance Criteria:

Given two overlapping point clouds and a coarse initial alignment, the ICP process converges to a more accurate alignment.

The final alignment accuracy is measurably better (lower RMS error) than the initial manual alignment by at least 30%.

The ICP process completes in under 15 minutes for two 10-million-point clouds on target hardware.

The algorithm correctly handles point clouds with only partial overlap.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: ICP Convergence Accuracy.

Test Data: Two identical point clouds. Apply a small, known transformation (e.g., 2-degree rotation, 5cm translation) to one to serve as the source. Use an identity matrix as the initialGuess.

Expected Result: The computed transformation from ICP must be the inverse of the known transformation, within a very high tolerance (e.g., < 0.1mm, < 0.01 degrees).

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for ICPRegistration.

User Story 2: Advanced ICP Variants for Robustness

Description: As an advanced user dealing with difficult scans (e.g., long corridors, noisy outdoor environments), I need access to more robust ICP algorithms. Specifically, a "point-to-plane" option would help with flat surfaces, and better outlier rejection would prevent bad data from corrupting the final alignment.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create PointToPlaneICP Class:

Create new files: src/algorithms/PointToPlaneICP.h and src/algorithms/PointToPlaneICP.cpp. This class will inherit from ICPRegistration.

Override the compute method.

Implement Point-to-Plane Error Metric:

The core loop will be similar to the base ICP.

However, the error to be minimized is not the distance between points, but the distance from each source point to the plane defined by its corresponding target point.

This requires having a normal vector for each point in the target cloud. These normals must be pre-calculated.

The transformation calculation will need to use a specialized algorithm that minimizes this point-to-plane distance (linearized with a small-angle approximation).

Implement Outlier Rejection:

In the base ICPRegistration class, after finding correspondences but before computing the transformation, add a new step.

Loop through all correspondence pairs and calculate the Euclidean distance for each.

Calculate the mean and standard deviation of all these distances.

Define a distance threshold, for example, mean + (2 * std_dev).

Create a new, filtered list of correspondences, including only those pairs whose distance is less than the threshold.

Use this filtered list to compute the transformation for the iteration.

Add UI for Algorithm Selection:

In the RegistrationWorkflowWidget, add a QComboBox UI element.

Populate it with two options: "Point-to-Point" and "Point-to-Plane".

When the user clicks "Run ICP", the AlignmentEngine will check the value of this QComboBox to decide which ICP class to instantiate and run.

References between Files:

PointToPlaneICP will inherit from ICPRegistration.

Both ICP classes will be used by the AlignmentEngine.

The UI in RegistrationWorkflowWidget will control which algorithm the AlignmentEngine uses.

Acceptance Criteria:

Point-to-plane ICP provides a faster and more stable convergence for scans of structured environments (e.g., buildings).

Robust ICP with outlier rejection successfully aligns scans even when up to 30% of the data is noise or contains significant outliers.

The user can select the desired ICP variant from a dropdown menu in the UI.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: Point-to-Plane vs. Point-to-Point.

Test Data: Two synthetic point clouds of a large, flat plane, slightly misaligned.

Expected Result: The point-to-plane algorithm should converge to the correct alignment in fewer iterations and with a lower final RMS error compared to the point-to-point algorithm.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test comparing the output of both ICP variants.

User Story 3: ICP Progress Monitoring and Control

Description: As a user running an ICP process that might take several minutes, I need to see real-time feedback on its progress. I want to see the iteration count and how the alignment error is changing, so I can assess if it is converging correctly. I also need a "Cancel" button to stop the process if it's taking too long or not producing a good result.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create ICPProgressWidget UI:

Create new files src/ui/ICPProgressWidget.h and src/ui/ICPProgressWidget.cpp.

This QWidget will contain a QProgressBar (to show iteration progress), a QLabel (to display text like "RMS Error: 1.5mm"), and a QPushButton labeled "Cancel".

Add Signaling to ICPRegistration:

In ICPRegistration.h, declare a new signal: progressUpdated(int iteration, float rmsError).

Inside the main ICP loop in ICPRegistration.cpp, after calculating the RMS error for the current iteration, emit this signal with the current iteration number and error value.

Connect Algorithm to UI:

Before starting the ICP process, the AlignmentEngine will show the ICPProgressWidget (e.g., as a modal dialog).

It will connect the ICPRegistration::progressUpdated signal to a slot that updates the progress bar and error label in the ICPProgressWidget.

Implement Cancellation Logic:

In ICPRegistration.h, add a public slot void cancel(). Also add a member variable std::atomic<bool> m_isCancelled;.

The cancel() slot will simply set m_isCancelled to true.

Connect the ICPProgressWidget's "Cancel" button clicked() signal to the ICPRegistration::cancel() slot.

At the beginning of each iteration in the main ICP loop, add an if (m_isCancelled) check. If it's true, break the loop immediately.

References between Files:

The AlignmentEngine will create and manage the ICPProgressWidget.

The ICPProgressWidget will be connected to signals from an active ICPRegistration instance.

Acceptance Criteria:

A progress dialog appears when ICP starts.

The progress bar and RMS error label in the dialog update after each ICP iteration.

Clicking the "Cancel" button immediately stops the ICP algorithm.

The application UI remains responsive and does not freeze while the ICP algorithm is running (i.e., it must run on a separate worker thread).

Testing Plan:

Test Case 3.1: Progress UI Update.

Test Data: Any pair of point clouds that will require at least 10 iterations to converge.

Expected Result: Run the ICP. The progress bar should visibly update, and the RMS error text should decrease with each iteration displayed in the dialog.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

Conclusion
Sprint 5 is a major milestone, delivering the core automated alignment functionality of the application. Upon completion, the software will be capable of performing high-precision, cloud-to-cloud registration, a fundamental requirement for any professional surveying tool. The combination of robust algorithms and clear user feedback will provide a powerful and reliable registration workflow. This sets the final foundation needed for Sprint 6, which will focus on exporting the now-registered data and generating quality reports.
