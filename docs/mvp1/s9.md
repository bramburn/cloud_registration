Sprint 9 Backlog: Advanced Registration Techniques
Sprint Goal: To elevate the application's registration capabilities by implementing a global optimization engine (Bundle Adjustment) for project-wide accuracy and introducing a feature-based registration method for more robust initial alignments in challenging scenarios.

Introduction
This document provides an atomic breakdown of the tasks for Sprint 9. Having established a complete pairwise registration workflow in the preceding sprints, the focus now shifts to advanced techniques that address the limitations of a sequential, pair-by-pair approach. This sprint will introduce two major features: a Global Registration (Bundle Adjustment) algorithm to simultaneously optimize all scan poses and minimize global error, and a Feature-Based Registration method that uses geometric features instead of raw points to find alignments, which is particularly effective for scans with limited or ambiguous overlap.

User Stories
User Story 1: Global Registration for Project-Wide Accuracy

Description: As a surveyor working on a large project with many scans (e.g., 10+), after aligning them pair-by-pair, I need a way to optimize all scan positions simultaneously. This "bundle adjustment" will distribute and minimize any accumulated registration errors across the entire project, ensuring the highest possible global accuracy for the final, merged point cloud.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create PoseGraph Data Structure:

Create a new file src/registration/PoseGraph.h.

Inside this file, define a struct PoseNode which contains a QString scanId and a QMatrix4x4 transform.

Define a struct PoseEdge which contains int fromNodeIndex, int toNodeIndex, and a float informationMatrix (representing the confidence of the link).

Define a class PoseGraph that contains a QList<PoseNode> nodes and a QList<PoseEdge> edges.

Implement PoseGraphBuilder:

Create a class PoseGraphBuilder in new files src/registration/PoseGraphBuilder.h/.cpp.

Implement a method PoseGraph build(const RegistrationProject& project).

This method will iterate through the project's saved registrations. For each registered scan pair, it will add two PoseNodes (if they don't already exist) and one PoseEdge to the graph. The edge's weight (information) should be inversely proportional to the registration's RMS error.

Create BundleAdjustment Engine:

Create new files: src/optimization/BundleAdjustment.h/.cpp.

Implement a method PoseGraph optimize(const PoseGraph& initialGraph).

Implement Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) Algorithm Inside optimize:

Step A (Setup): Define the state vector. This will be a large vector containing the 6-DoF pose parameters (e.g., 3 for translation, 3 for rotation as axis-angle) for every scan except the first one (which remains fixed at the origin).

Step B (Error Calculation): Write a function to calculate the total error. This function will loop through every PoseEdge in the graph. For each edge, it will compute the difference (residual) between the edge's measured transformation and the transformation calculated from the current poses of the two nodes in the state vector.

Step C (Jacobian Calculation): Analytically or numerically compute the Jacobian matrix, which represents the partial derivatives of the error function with respect to each variable in the state vector.

Step D (LM Loop): Start a for loop that runs for a max number of iterations. Inside the loop, compute the approximated Hessian matrix (J^T * J) and the error vector (J^T * e). Solve the linear system (J^T * J + lambda * I) * delta = J^T * e to find the update step delta. Update the state vector (all scan poses) by adding delta. Recalculate the total error. If the error decreased, decrease the damping parameter lambda; if it increased, revert the update and increase lambda.

Step E (Convergence Check): The loop terminates if the change in error is below a threshold or max iterations are reached.

Integrate into UI:

Add a QPushButton labeled "Globally Optimize Project" to the RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

When clicked, this button will: 1. Call PoseGraphBuilder::build(). 2. Call BundleAdjustment::optimize(). 3. Update the transformations of all scans in the project with the results. 4. Trigger a re-render of the 3D view.

References between Files:

The UI button will trigger a method in the AlignmentEngine.

AlignmentEngine will use PoseGraphBuilder and BundleAdjustment.

BundleAdjustment will use the Eigen library for all matrix and vector operations.

Acceptance Criteria:

After running the global optimization, the final average RMS error across all scan pairs is lower than the average before optimization.

In a project with a loop closure (e.g., Scan A -> B -> C -> A), any visible misalignment at the closure point is visibly reduced or eliminated.

The optimization process for a project with 20 scans completes in under 2 minutes on target hardware.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: Loop Closure Test.

Test Data: A synthetic dataset of four scans (A, B, C, D) arranged in a square. Register A-B, B-C, C-D, and D-A sequentially. Introduce a small artificial error into the D-A registration.

Expected Result: Before global optimization, there will be a visible gap/overlap between the initial pose of A and the pose of A calculated through the loop. After running Bundle Adjustment, this gap must be eliminated, and the error should be distributed among all four registrations.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test and manual visual inspection.

User Story 2: Feature-Based Registration for Initial Alignment

Description: As a user trying to align scans of an environment with repeating geometry (like a long, uniform tunnel) or very little overlap, I need a registration method that uses larger geometric features, like planes. This "cloud-to-cloud" alignment based on features will provide a much more robust and accurate initial guess than manually picking a few ambiguous points, preventing the standard ICP from failing.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Implement Plane Detection Algorithm:

Create a FeatureExtractor class in src/features/FeatureExtractor.h/.cpp.

Implement a method QList<Plane> extractPlanes(const PointCloud& pc).

Inside this method, use a RANSAC-based approach:

Loop for N iterations. In each iteration, randomly pick 3 points, define a candidate plane.

Count the number of inlier points (points within a certain distance threshold of the plane).

The plane with the most inliers is considered a detected feature.

Add the detected plane to a list.

Crucially: Remove the inlier points of the detected plane from the point cloud before starting the next RANSAC iteration to find the next plane.

Implement Feature Matching Logic:

Create a FeatureBasedRegistration class in src/registration/FeatureBasedRegistration.h/.cpp.

Implement a method QList<QPair<Plane, Plane>> findPlaneCorrespondences(const QList<Plane>& planes1, const QList<Plane>& planes2).

Inside this method, loop through each plane in planes1. For each one, loop through all planes in planes2.

A pair of planes is considered a match if: 1) The angle between their normal vectors is very small (e.g., < 5 degrees), AND 2) The perpendicular distance between the two planes is small (e.g., < 50cm).

Compute Transformation from Plane Correspondences:

Implement a method TransformationMatrix computeTransformFromPlanes(const QList<QPair<Plane, Plane>>& matches).

Step 1 (Rotation): The rotation can be found by calculating the transformation that aligns the set of normal vectors from the source planes to the normal vectors of the target planes. This can be solved using the same SVD-based method as in Sprint 4, but using the 3D normal vectors instead of points.

Step 2 (Translation): After finding the rotation, the translation can be found by minimizing the distances between the centroids of the corresponding planes.

Integrate into UI:

Add a new QPushButton labeled "Align by Features" to the RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

When clicked, this will trigger the entire process: extract planes from both scans, find correspondences, compute the transformation, and apply it as a preview in the 3D view.

References between Files:

AlignmentEngine will use FeatureExtractor and FeatureBasedRegistration.

FeatureBasedRegistration may reuse parts of LeastSquaresAlignment for its calculation.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system can successfully detect at least the 3 largest planar surfaces in a test scan of a simple room.

For two scans of the same room from different positions, the system correctly identifies the corresponding walls/floors as plane matches.

The "Align by Features" button produces an initial alignment that is visually close to the correct solution, serving as a good starting point for ICP.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: Plane Detection Test.

Test Data: A synthetic point cloud of a perfect cube.

Expected Result: The extractPlanes method must return a list of exactly 6 Plane objects. The normal vector for each detected plane must be perfectly aligned with one of the cardinal axes (e.g., (1,0,0), (0,-1,0), etc.).

Testing Tool: GTest unit test.

User Story 3: Visual Registration Analysis Tools

Description: As a user assessing the quality of my final registration, I need to see a color-coded heat map that visually highlights the areas of greatest difference between the two scans. This allows me to instantly spot areas of high tension or misalignment, helping me decide if the registration is acceptable or if it needs further refinement.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Implement DifferenceAnalysis Class:

Create new files src/analysis/DifferenceAnalysis.h/.cpp.

Implement a method QVector<float> calculateDistances(const PointCloud& source, const PointCloud& target).

Inside this method, first build a K-D Tree from the target point cloud.

Then, for each point in the source cloud, use the K-D Tree to find its single nearest neighbor in the target cloud.

Calculate the Euclidean distance between this pair of points.

Store this distance in a QVector<float> that has the same size as the source point cloud.

Create Color Map Texture:

Create a new method QOpenGLTexture* createColorMapTexture() in PointCloudViewerWidget.

Inside this method, create a 1D QImage (e.g., 256x1 pixels).

Loop from 0 to 255. In each step, calculate a color corresponding to a gradient (e.g., blue for 0, green for 128, red for 255). Set the pixel in the QImage to this color.

Create a QOpenGLTexture from this QImage.

Modify Rendering Pipeline for Heat Map:

Add a new vertex attribute to the point cloud VBO to hold the per-vertex distance value.

Modify the vertex shader (pointcloud.vert) to accept this new attribute and pass it to the fragment shader.

Modify the fragment shader (pointcloud.frag):

Add a uniform sampler1D colorMapTexture.

Add a uniform bool enableDifferenceMap.

Add a uniform float maxDistance.

Inside main(), add an if (enableDifferenceMap) block.

Inside the block, normalize the incoming distance attribute by dividing it by maxDistance.

Use this normalized value as a texture coordinate to look up a color from the colorMapTexture: fragColor = texture(colorMapTexture, normalizedDistance);.

Add UI Toggle:

Add a QCheckBox labeled "Show Difference Heat Map" to the RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

When this checkbox is toggled, it will call a slot in MainWindow that: 1. Runs the DifferenceAnalysis::calculateDistances method. 2. Uploads the resulting distance data to the VBO. 3. Sets the enableDifferenceMap and maxDistance uniforms in the shader and triggers a repaint.

References between Files:

PointCloudViewerWidget will use the DifferenceAnalysis class.

The shader files (pointcloud.vert and pointcloud.frag) will be updated with new uniforms and logic.

The RegistrationWorkflowWidget UI will have a checkbox to control this feature.

Acceptance Criteria:

When the "Show Difference Heat Map" checkbox is checked, the point cloud's color changes to a blue-to-red gradient.

In an area where two scans are known to be misaligned by a few millimeters, the heat map shows a red or yellow color.

In an area where the alignment is perfect, the heat map shows a blue color.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 3.1: Heat Map Color Verification.

Test Data: Two identical, perfectly aligned planes. Manually translate one point on the source plane by 5mm.

Expected Result: Enable the difference map. The entire point cloud should appear solid blue, except for a single red "hotspot" at the location of the translated point.

Testing Tool: Manual visual inspection.

Conclusion
Upon completion of Sprint 9, the application will have evolved from a standard pairwise registration tool into a powerful platform capable of handling complex, multi-scan projects with high global accuracy. The addition of Global Registration provides a critical optimization step for professional users, while Feature-Based Registration offers a robust solution for challenging datasets. These advanced features solidify the application's position as a comprehensive and professional-grade solution, ready for user feedback and further refinement.
