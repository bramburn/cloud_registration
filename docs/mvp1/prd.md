# FARO Scene Point Cloud Registration MVP Implementation Plan

Based on my analysis of the current codebase and MVP requirements, I've developed a comprehensive implementation plan consisting of a Product Requirements Document and 8 detailed sprint backlogs to complete the MVP.

## Current State Analysis

The codebase already has a solid foundation with:
- Project management system with recent projects functionality[1][2]
- Point cloud loading for E57 and LAS formats[1][2]
- Voxel grid filtering with performance optimization[1][2]
- Decoupled architecture using MVP pattern with interfaces[1][2]
- Comprehensive testing framework with mocks[1][2]
- Performance profiling system[1][2]

The MVP gaps that need implementation include 3D visualization, registration workflow UI, target detection, manual alignment, ICP registration, and export functionality[1][2].
