Sprint 2 Backlog: Registration Workflow UI Foundation
Sprint Goal: To construct the essential user interface framework that will guide a user through the multi-step process of point cloud registration. This sprint focuses on creating the visual containers, state management, and foundational data models for handling multiple scans and registration targets.

Introduction
This document provides an atomic breakdown of the tasks required for Sprint 2. Following the successful implementation of the 3D viewer in Sprint 1, this sprint shifts focus to the user experience of the registration process itself. We will build the user-facing shell that will host the comparison views, target management panels, and alignment tools in subsequent sprints. The core deliverables are a state-managed workflow widget, a dual-viewer for scan comparison with synchronized controls, and the underlying data structures for registration targets and projects.

User Stories
User Story 1: Guided Registration Workflow

Description: As a surveyor, I need a structured, step-by-step user interface to guide me through the registration process. This ensures that I follow a logical and repeatable sequence of actions—from selecting scans to aligning them and reviewing the results—which minimizes errors and improves the efficiency of my work.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create WorkflowStateMachine Class:

Create new files: src/registration/WorkflowStateMachine.h and src/registration/WorkflowStateMachine.cpp.

In WorkflowStateMachine.h, define an enum class RegistrationStep { SelectScans, TargetDetection, ManualAlignment, ICPRegistration, QualityReview, Export }.

Implement a state machine that defines valid transitions (e.g., from SelectScans to TargetDetection). It should have methods like bool canTransitionTo(RegistrationStep nextStep) and void transitionTo(RegistrationStep nextStep).

Create RegistrationWorkflowWidget:

Create new files: src/registration/RegistrationWorkflowWidget.h and src/registration/RegistrationWorkflowWidget.cpp.

This class will be a QWidget that uses a QStackedWidget to display different UI components for each step of the workflow.

Instantiate the WorkflowStateMachine.

Add "Next" and "Back" QPushButtons. The "Next" button's clicked() signal will trigger a state transition in the state machine. The button should be disabled if the transition is invalid.

Create WorkflowProgressWidget:

Create new files: src/ui/WorkflowProgressWidget.h and src/ui/WorkflowProgressWidget.cpp.

Implement a visual "stepper" or "breadcrumb" UI that displays all steps from the RegistrationStep enum.

The current step should be visually highlighted (e.g., different color or bolder font).

This widget will be placed at the top of the RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

Extend Project Class:

Create a new RegistrationProject class that inherits from the existing Project class.

In RegistrationProject.h, add member variables to store registration-specific data: QList<ScanInfo> scans, QList<Target> targets, and QList<TargetCorrespondence> correspondences.

References between Files:

MainWindow will create and display the RegistrationWorkflowWidget when a registration session begins.

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will contain instances of WorkflowStateMachine and WorkflowProgressWidget.

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will hold a pointer to the active RegistrationProject.

Acceptance Criteria:

The RegistrationWorkflowWidget is displayed on the screen.

The WorkflowProgressWidget correctly displays all defined registration steps.

Clicking the "Next" button advances the state machine to the next logical step and updates the WorkflowProgressWidget to highlight the new step.

The "Back" button correctly transitions to the previous state.

The "Next" button is disabled if the criteria for the current step are not met (e.g., two scans are not selected in the SelectScans step).

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: Verify State Machine Transitions.

Test Data: N/A.

Expected Result: Call transitionTo() with valid and invalid next steps. Assert that the state machine only changes state for valid transitions and that canTransitionTo() returns the correct boolean value in all cases.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for WorkflowStateMachine.

Test Case 1.2: Verify UI Workflow Navigation.

Test Data: A mock RegistrationProject.

Expected Result: Manually click "Next" and "Back" buttons. The UI in the QStackedWidget should change, and the WorkflowProgressWidget should update its highlighting accordingly.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

User Story 2: Side-by-Side Scan Comparison

Description: As a surveyor, I want to view two separate scans simultaneously in a side-by-side 3D view. This is essential for visually identifying common features, landmarks, or pre-placed targets across the two scans, which is the basis for creating accurate correspondences.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create ScanComparisonView Widget:

Create new files: src/registration/ScanComparisonView.h and src/registration/ScanComparisonView.cpp.

This QWidget will contain a QSplitter widget.

Instantiate two PointCloudViewerWidget objects (from Sprint 1). Add them to the QSplitter to create the side-by-side layout.

Implement SynchronizedCameraController:

Create new files: src/camera/SynchronizedCameraController.h and src/camera/SynchronizedCameraController.cpp.

This class will inherit from CameraController.

It will hold two pointers to IPointCloudViewer interfaces, one for each viewer.

Implement methods like orbit(deltaX, deltaY), pan(deltaX, deltaY), and zoom(delta). Each method must call the corresponding camera manipulation method on both viewer instances.

Add a bool m_isSyncEnabled flag and a setSyncEnabled(bool) method to toggle the synchronized movement.

Integrate Synchronized Controls:

The ScanComparisonView will instantiate the SynchronizedCameraController.

It will pass its two PointCloudViewerWidget instances to the controller.

Mouse events from both PointCloudViewerWidgets will be forwarded to the single SynchronizedCameraController instance.

References between Files:

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will display the ScanComparisonView during the target selection and manual alignment steps.

ScanComparisonView will contain two PointCloudViewerWidget instances.

ScanComparisonView will use the SynchronizedCameraController to manage camera movements.

Acceptance Criteria:

Two PointCloudViewerWidget instances are displayed horizontally next to each other.

Loading a scan into the left viewer displays it correctly, and the same for the right.

When camera synchronization is enabled, orbiting, panning, or zooming in one view causes the other view's camera to move identically.

When synchronization is disabled, each view can be navigated independently.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: Verify Synchronized Orbit.

Test Data: Two distinct point clouds (e.g., cube and sphere).

Expected Result: Load the cube into the left viewer and the sphere into the right. With sync enabled, dragging the mouse left-to-right in the left view should cause both the cube and the sphere to orbit in the same manner.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

Test Case 2.2: Verify Independent Navigation.

Test Data: Two distinct point clouds.

Expected Result: With sync disabled, panning the left view should not affect the right view's camera at all.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

User Story 3: Foundational Target Management System

Description: As a user preparing for registration, I need a system to define and organize registration targets. This involves creating different types of targets (like spheres or checkerboards) and associating them with specific scans, which is the foundational step before I can create correspondences between them.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Define Target Data Models:

In a new file src/registration/Target.h, define a base Target struct with a QString targetId and a QVector3D position.

Create derived structs: SphereTarget (adds a float radius), CheckerboardTarget (adds a QList<QVector3D> cornerPoints), and NaturalPointTarget.

Create TargetManager Class:

Create new files: src/registration/TargetManager.h and src/registration/TargetManager.cpp.

This class will manage QList<Target*> for each scan.

Implement methods: void addTarget(const QString& scanId, Target* target), void removeTarget(const QString& targetId), Target* getTarget(const QString& targetId).

Create TargetManagementPanel UI:

Create new files: src/ui/TargetManagementPanel.h and src/ui/TargetManagementPanel.cpp.

This QWidget will contain a QTableView and will use a QStandardItemModel to display the list of targets for the currently selected scans.

The table should have columns for: Target ID, Type, X, Y, Z.

Define TargetCorrespondence Model:

In a new file src/registration/TargetCorrespondence.h, define a struct TargetCorrespondence containing QString targetId1, QString targetId2, and QString scanId1, QString scanId2. This links a target from one scan to a target in another.

References between Files:

RegistrationProject will own an instance of TargetManager.

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will display the TargetManagementPanel.

TargetManagementPanel will get its data from the TargetManager.

Acceptance Criteria:

The application can programmatically create SphereTarget and CheckerboardTarget objects.

The TargetManagementPanel UI correctly displays a list of targets added to the TargetManager.

A TargetCorrespondence object can be created to link two target IDs.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 3.1: Target Creation and Management.

Test Data: N/A.

Expected Result: Instantiate a TargetManager. Call addTarget() with mock SphereTarget and CheckerboardTarget objects. Call getTarget() and assert that the returned target data matches what was added.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for TargetManager.

Test Case 3.2: UI Panel Display.

Test Data: A TargetManager populated with several mock targets.

Expected Result: The TargetManagementPanel's QTableView should display one row for each target, with the correct data in each column.

Testing Tool: Automated UI test or manual verification.

Conclusion
By the end of Sprint 2, the project will have a complete, albeit non-functional, UI shell for the registration workflow. This includes the main workflow widget, the dual-view comparison tool with synchronized cameras, and the necessary data structures and UI panels for managing targets. This foundational work is crucial, as it provides the framework and context for the core algorithmic work—target detection and alignment—that will be implemented in the subsequent sprints.
