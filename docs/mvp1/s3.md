Sprint 3 Backlog: Target Detection & Selection Systems
Sprint Goal: To implement the core algorithms and user interface components necessary for identifying and selecting registration targets within point clouds. This includes automatic detection of artificial targets (spheres, checkerboards) and manual selection of natural features.

Introduction
This document provides a highly detailed, atomic breakdown of the tasks for Sprint 3. Building upon the UI framework from Sprint 2, this sprint introduces the first set of algorithmic intelligence to the application. The primary goal is to empower the user to define points of correspondence between different scans. This will be achieved by creating robust backend algorithms for target detection and providing precise UI tools for manual selection and validation in the 3D viewer.

User Stories
User Story 1: Automatic Sphere Target Detection

Description: As a surveyor, I need the software to automatically detect sphere targets in my scans. This saves me a significant amount of time and reduces the potential for human error compared to manually measuring and identifying each target, leading to a faster and more reliable initial registration setup.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create Base Detection Class:

Create new files: src/detection/TargetDetectionBase.h and src/detection/TargetDetectionBase.cpp.

In TargetDetectionBase.h, define an abstract class TargetDetectionBase with a pure virtual method: virtual QList<Target*> detect(const PointCloud& pc, const QVariantMap& params) = 0;.

Create Sphere Detector Class:

Create new files: src/detection/SphereDetector.h and src/detection/SphereDetector.cpp.

In SphereDetector.h, define the SphereDetector class, making it inherit publicly from TargetDetectionBase.

Implement the detect method in SphereDetector.cpp.

Implement RANSAC Algorithm Inside detect method:

Retrieve parameters like minRadius, maxRadius, distanceThreshold, and maxIterations from the input params map.

Initialize an empty list to store the best sphere model found so far.

Start a for loop that runs for maxIterations.

Inside the loop, randomly select 3 distinct points from the input point cloud pc.

From these 3 points, mathematically compute the center and radius of a candidate sphere.

Create a second for loop to iterate through every point in the entire point cloud pc.

For each point, calculate its distance from the surface of the candidate sphere.

If the distance is less than distanceThreshold, add the point to a list of "inliers" for the current iteration.

After the inner loop completes, compare the number of inliers to the best model found so far. If the current model is better, replace the best model with the current candidate sphere and its inliers.

Refine and Validate Detected Sphere:

After the main RANSAC loop, take the inlier points from the best model found.

Perform a least-squares fitting on these inlier points to calculate a more accurate, refined sphere center and radius.

Create a new SphereTarget object using the refined data.

Calculate a quality metric (e.g., RMS error of inliers to the refined sphere surface). Store this in the SphereTarget object.

Add the created SphereTarget object to a list of detected targets to be returned.

References between Files:

RegistrationWorkflowWidget will invoke the SphereDetector.

SphereDetector will inherit from TargetDetectionBase.

SphereDetector will create instances of SphereTarget (defined in src/registration/Target.h).

The results from SphereDetector will be added to the TargetManager (from Sprint 2).

Acceptance Criteria:

When given a point cloud containing sphere-like shapes, the detect method returns a list of SphereTarget objects.

The detected sphere's center position must be accurate to within +/- 2mm of the ground truth for synthetic data.

The detected sphere's radius must be accurate to within +/- 2mm of the ground truth.

The detection process must complete in under 30 seconds for a 10 million point cloud on target hardware.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: Sphere Detection Accuracy.

Test Data: A synthetic point cloud file (test_sphere_clean.xyz) containing a perfect sphere of 150mm diameter.

Expected Result: The detect method must return exactly one SphereTarget. The detected radius must be 75mm (+/- 0.5mm). The center must be within 0.5mm of the known center.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for SphereDetector.

Test Case 1.2: Detection with Noise.

Test Data: A synthetic point cloud file (test_sphere_noisy.xyz) containing a sphere with 5% Gaussian noise added to its points.

Expected Result: The detect method must still identify the sphere. Accuracy for radius and center should be within the specified +/- 2mm tolerance.

Testing Tool: GTest unit test for SphereDetector.

User Story 2: Manual Selection of Natural Points

Description: As a surveyor working with scans that lack artificial targets, I need to be able to manually select distinct, corresponding points (like the corner of a building or a unique rock) in each of the two side-by-side scan views. This allows me to perform registrations even when no pre-planned targets are available.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Implement Point Picking Raycasting:

In PointCloudViewerWidget, modify the mousePressEvent handler.

When the user clicks, get the 2D screen coordinates of the mouse cursor.

Un-project the 2D screen coordinates into a 3D ray in world space. This requires using the inverse of the view and projection matrices. The ray should have an origin (the camera's position) and a direction vector.

Find Closest Point to Ray:

Create a new method in PointCloudViewerWidget called findClosestPoint(const Ray& ray).

Inside this method, iterate through all points in the point cloud.

For each point, calculate its perpendicular distance to the 3D ray.

Keep track of the point with the smallest distance to the ray.

Highlight Selected Point and Create Target:

Once the closest point is found, render a visual marker (e.g., a small, brightly colored sphere or cube) at its location in the 3D view.

Create a new NaturalPointTarget object with the coordinates of the selected point.

Add this new target to the TargetManager for the corresponding scan view (left or right).

Display Selection in UI:

The TargetManagementPanel (from Sprint 2) must be updated to show the newly created NaturalPointTarget.

References between Files:

PointCloudViewerWidget needs to get point data to perform the closest-point search.

PointCloudViewerWidget will create a NaturalPointTarget and add it to the TargetManager.

TargetManager's data updates will be reflected in the TargetManagementPanel's model.

Acceptance Criteria:

When a user clicks in one of the 3D views, a point in the cloud close to the mouse cursor is visually highlighted.

A new NaturalPointTarget is created and appears in the TargetManagementPanel UI list.

The selection is precise enough to reliably pick a specific feature from a moderate viewing distance.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: Point Selection Precision.

Test Data: A point cloud of a simple geometric shape, like a cube.

Expected Result: Manually click on a specific corner of the cube. The visually highlighted point and the created NaturalPointTarget should have coordinates that are within a small tolerance (e.g., 1cm) of the known corner's coordinates.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing and visual inspection.

Conclusion
At the conclusion of Sprint 3, the application will possess the core capabilities for defining registration correspondences. Users will be able to automatically find sphere targets and manually select natural feature points. This sprint delivers the first piece of the core registration intelligence, moving the application from a simple viewer to a specialized engineering tool. The groundwork laid here is fundamental for the next sprint, which will focus on using these created targets to perform the manual alignment transformation.
