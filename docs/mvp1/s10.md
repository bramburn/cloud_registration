Sprint 10 Backlog: Advanced Usability & Workflow Enhancements
Sprint Goal: To elevate the application from a functional tool to a highly polished, user-centric product by implementing an Undo/Redo system, advanced data management features, and customizable reporting, thereby significantly improving workflow efficiency and user confidence.

Introduction
This document provides an atomic breakdown of the tasks for Sprint 10. Following the implementation of advanced registration algorithms, this sprint focuses on refining the user experience and adding powerful features for managing complex project data. The primary objectives are to make the application more forgiving and intuitive through a comprehensive Undo/Redo system, to provide power users with tools to merge and split scan data, and to offer greater flexibility in generating customized reports.

User Stories
User Story 1: Forgiving Undo/Redo System

Description: As a user who frequently experiments with different target selections, I need a robust Undo/Redo system. If I make a mistake, like deleting the wrong cluster or adding an incorrect correspondence, I want to be able to instantly undo that action with a single click or keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Z) instead of having to manually fix it, which saves time and encourages experimentation.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create QUndoCommand Subclasses for Each Action:

Target Creation: Create a CreateTargetCommand class inheriting from QUndoCommand. Its constructor will store the target's data. The redo() method will add the target to the TargetManager. The undo() method will remove it.

Cluster Creation: Create a CreateClusterCommand class. redo() will call ProjectManager::createCluster. undo() will call ProjectManager::deleteCluster.

Scan Movement: Create a MoveScanCommand class. It will store the scan ID and the source/destination cluster IDs. redo() will move the scan to the destination cluster. undo() will move it back to the source cluster.

Alignment Computation: Create an ApplyAlignmentCommand class. It will store the transformation matrix before and after the computation. redo() will apply the new matrix. undo() will apply the old one.

Integrate QUndoStack into MainWindow:

In MainWindow.h, add a member variable: QUndoStack* m_undoStack;.

In the MainWindow constructor, instantiate it: m_undoStack = new QUndoStack(this);.

Modify Action Handlers to Use Commands:

Locate the existing methods where actions are performed (e.g., where a target is created, a cluster is created, an alignment is computed).

Instead of calling the function directly, instantiate the corresponding command object (e.g., new CreateTargetCommand(...)).

Push the command onto the undo stack: m_undoStack->push(command);. The QUndoStack will automatically execute the command's redo() method the first time.

Connect UI Actions for Undo/Redo:

In MainWindow::setupMenuBar(), create two new QActions: m_undoAction and m_redoAction.

Use m_undoStack->createUndoAction() and m_undoStack->createRedoAction() to automatically link these actions to the stack. This handles enabling/disabling the actions and setting their text (e.g., "Undo Create Cluster").

Add these QActions to the "Edit" menu.

References between Files:

MainWindow will own the central QUndoStack.

Various manager classes (ProjectManager, TargetManager, AlignmentEngine) will now have their methods called from within the undo() and redo() implementations of the QUndoCommand subclasses.

Acceptance Criteria:

After creating a new cluster, pressing Ctrl+Z (or selecting Edit -> Undo) removes the cluster from the UI. Pressing Ctrl+Y (or Redo) makes it reappear.

After moving a scan into a cluster, undoing the action moves the scan back to its original location.

After computing a manual alignment, undoing the action reverts the 3D preview to the state it was in before the alignment was computed.

The "Undo" and "Redo" menu items are correctly enabled or disabled based on the state of the undo stack.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 1.1: Multi-Step Undo/Redo Sequence.

Test Data: A project with two loaded scans.

Expected Result: 1. Create a cluster (Action 1). 2. Move a scan into it (Action 2). 3. Press Undo twice. The scan should move back to the root, and then the cluster should be deleted. 4. Press Redo twice. The cluster should be recreated, and then the scan should move back into it.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

User Story 2: Advanced Data and Cluster Management

Description: As a power user managing a very large and complex project, I need more advanced tools to organize my data. I want the ability to merge multiple registered clusters into a single logical group, and also to split a single, oversized scan file into smaller, more manageable chunks based on their physical location.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Implement Cluster Merging Logic:

In ProjectManager.h/.cpp, create a new method: bool mergeClusters(const QStringList& sourceClusterIds, const QString& destinationClusterId).

Inside this method, loop through each sourceClusterId.

For each one, get a list of all scans and sub-clusters it contains by calling the SQLiteManager.

For each scan, call the existing moveScanToCluster method to move it to the destinationClusterId.

For each sub-cluster, update its parentClusterId in the database to be the destinationClusterId.

After moving all contents, call deleteCluster on the now-empty source cluster.

Add a "Merge Into..." action to the cluster context menu in SidebarWidget.

Implement Scan Splitting Pre-computation (K-Means Clustering):

Create a new class src/analysis/SpatialAnalyzer.h/.cpp.

Implement a method QList<QList<int>> findSpatialClusters(const PointCloud& pc, int numClusters).

Inside this method, implement a K-Means clustering algorithm:

Randomly initialize numClusters centroid positions within the point cloud's bounding box.

Start a loop. In the loop, assign each point in the point cloud to its nearest centroid.

After all points are assigned, recalculate the position of each centroid to be the average position of all the points assigned to it.

Repeat the loop until the centroid positions stop changing significantly.

Return a list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of the points belonging to one cluster.

Implement Scan Splitting Action:

In ProjectManager, create a new method: bool splitScan(const QString& sourceScanId, int numChunks).

Inside this method, first load the full point cloud data for the sourceScanId.

Call SpatialAnalyzer::findSpatialClusters to get the point indices for each chunk.

Loop from 1 to numChunks. For each chunk:

Create a new ScanInfo object with a new name (e.g., "OriginalName_Part1").

Create a new point cloud file on disk (e.g., a .xyz text file for simplicity).

Write only the points belonging to the current chunk into this new file.

Add the new ScanInfo record to the database, pointing to the new file.

After creating all new scans, delete the original sourceScanId from the project.

Add UI for Splitting:

Add a "Split Scan..." action to the scan context menu in SidebarWidget.

When clicked, show a QInputDialog asking the user for the desired number of chunks.

Call ProjectManager::splitScan with the result.

References between Files:

ProjectManager will be updated with mergeClusters and splitScan methods.

ProjectManager will use the new SpatialAnalyzer class.

SidebarWidget context menus will be updated to include the new actions.

Acceptance Criteria:

A user can select two or more clusters, right-click, and merge them. All scans from the source clusters appear under the destination cluster.

A user can right-click a large scan, choose to split it into 3 chunks, and three new scan items appear in the project tree, while the original disappears.

When viewing one of the new split scans, it only contains a spatially distinct subset of the original points.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 2.1: Cluster Merge Verification.

Test Data: Create a project with "Cluster A" (containing Scan1) and "Cluster B" (containing Scan2).

Expected Result: Merge Cluster B into Cluster A. The SidebarWidget UI should now show only "Cluster A", which contains both Scan1 and Scan2. Cluster B should be gone.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

User Story 3: Customizable Reporting and Exporting

Description: As a user creating deliverables for a client, I need more control over the final output. I want to be able to define my own report layout by choosing which sections to include (e.g., quality metrics, screenshots, scan metadata) and in what order. I also need the ability to export a subsampled version of the point cloud to create smaller files for easy sharing.

Extremely Atomic Actions to Undertake:

Create ReportTemplate Data Structure:

In a new file src/reporting/ReportTemplate.h, define a struct ReportSection with a QString title and an enum SectionType { MetricsTable, Screenshot, Notes }.

Define a ReportTemplate class that holds a QList<ReportSection>.

Create ReportTemplateEditor UI:

Create a new dialog src/ui/ReportTemplateEditor.h/.cpp.

This dialog will have two QListWidgets side-by-side: "Available Sections" and "Report Layout".

The left list will be populated with all possible section types. The right list will represent the current template layout.

Add buttons to move items between the lists, and up/down buttons to reorder items in the right-hand list.

Add "Save Template" and "Load Template" buttons that serialize the ReportTemplate object to a JSON file.

Modify ReportGenerator:

Change the generatePdfReport method to accept a ReportTemplate object: generatePdfReport(const ReportData& data, const ReportTemplate& tpl, ...).

Inside the method, loop through the sections in the tpl.

Use a switch statement on the section.type. For each case, call the appropriate drawing function (e.g., for MetricsTable, call drawMetricsTable()). This will render the report according to the user-defined layout.

Add Subsampling to ExportDialog:

In ExportDialog.ui, add a new QGroupBox labeled "Subsampling".

Inside, add a QCheckBox "Enable Subsampling" and a QSpinBox labeled "Export every Nth point:".

Implement Subsampling in PointCloudExporter:

In PointCloudExporter, before starting the export, check if subsampling is enabled.

If it is, create a new, smaller point cloud vector.

Loop through the original point cloud, and for every N points (where N is the value from the spin box), copy one point into the new vector.

Pass this new, smaller vector to the IFormatWriter instead of the original full-resolution point cloud.

References between Files:

ReportGenerator will now use ReportTemplate objects to define its output.

QualityDashboard will have a button to launch the ReportTemplateEditor dialog.

ExportDialog will pass the new subsampling options to the PointCloudExporter.

Acceptance Criteria:

The user can create a report template that omits the metrics table but includes two screenshots, and the generated PDF reflects this exact layout.

A user can save a report template, close the application, reopen it, load the template, and the editor will show the saved layout.

A user can export a 10-million-point cloud with the "Export every 10th point" option selected. The resulting file must contain exactly 1 million points.

Testing Plan:

Test Case 3.1: Custom Report Layout.

Test Data: A completed registration project.

Expected Result: Use the ReportTemplateEditor to create a template with the layout: Screenshot, then Metrics Table. Generate the PDF. The resulting PDF must show the screenshot on the first page and the metrics table on the second page, in that specific order.

Testing Tool: Manual UI testing.

Conclusion
Sprint 10 represents a significant leap in the application's maturity, moving beyond core functionality to focus on sophisticated user-centric features. The Undo/Redo system will make the software dramatically more robust and less intimidating for users, while the advanced data management tools provide essential flexibility for complex projects. Customizable outputs ensure the application's deliverables can be tailored to meet diverse professional standards. Upon completion, the application will not only be a powerful registration engine but also a polished, flexible, and resilient professional tool.
