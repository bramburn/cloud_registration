# Sprint W2 Backlog: E57 Writing - Writing XYZ Point Data to E57

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 1, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
**Sprint Goal:** To enable the `E57WriterLib` to take application-provided XYZ point data and write it into the `CompressedVectorNode` of the E57 file structure defined in Sprint W1. This includes preparing `SourceDestBuffer`s, using `CompressedVectorWriter` to write data in blocks, calculating and writing the `cartesianBounds` for the scan, and ensuring the `CompressedVectorNode` accurately reflects the number of points written.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the backlog items for Sprint W2 of Phase 1: "E57 Writing Capabilities," as detailed in the PRD `prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering`. Building upon the E57 file structure and prototype definition accomplished in Sprint W1, this sprint focuses on the critical task of writing actual Cartesian (XYZ) point data to the E57 file. Key activities will involve preparing data buffers for `libE57Format`, utilizing the `CompressedVectorWriter` to write point records in manageable blocks, computing the `cartesianBounds` from the point data, and correctly updating the E57 metadata to reflect the written point count. The primary outcome of this sprint will be the ability to generate valid E57 files containing actual point cloud geometry that can be successfully loaded and visualized in other E57-compliant software.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story W2.1: Write XYZ Point Data to E57 CompressedVectorNode

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to accept a collection of 3D points (XYZ coordinates) from the application and write this data into the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` of a scan within an E57 file,
* **So that** the geometric data of a point cloud can be accurately exported and stored in the E57 format.
    * **Description**: This user story covers the core functionality of transferring point data from the application's memory representation (e.g., `std::vector<float>` or a custom point struct) into the binary section of the E57 file, associated with the `CompressedVectorNode` defined in Sprint W1. It involves setting up `e57::SourceDestBuffer`s to map the application data to the E57 prototype fields (`cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ`), creating an `e57::CompressedVectorWriter`, and iteratively writing the data in blocks. The `recordCount` (or `childCount`) of the `CompressedVectorNode` must be correctly updated to reflect the number of points written.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W2.1.1**: Define or extend a method in `E57WriterLib` (e.g., `writePoints(int scanIndex, const std::vector<PointType>& points)`) to accept point data from the application. `PointType` could be a simple struct `{double x, y, z;}` or an interleaved `std::vector<double>`.
            * *Input*: Scan index, reference to application's point data.
            * *Output*: Points written to the E57 file's binary section.
        * **Task W2.1.2**: Retrieve the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` for the specified `scanIndex` (created in Sprint W1).
        * **Task W2.1.3**: Prepare `std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer>` for `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ`. These buffers will point to segments of the application's point data. Assume data is provided as `double` for direct mapping to the double-precision `FloatNode`s defined in the Sprint W1 prototype.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf` (obtained from `E57WriterLib`'s member), application point data, block size.
            * *Output*: Configured `sdbufs` vector.
            * *Reference Code (Preparing SourceDestBuffer for writing cartesianX)*:
                ```cpp
                // In E57WriterLib, assuming m_imageFile is the std::unique_ptr<e57::ImageFile>
                // Assuming appPoints is std::vector<MyAppPointStruct> where MyAppPointStruct has double x, y, z;
                // const int64_t POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK = 10000; // Example block size
                // std::vector<double> xAppBlockBuffer(POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK); // Temporary buffer for X coordinates of current block
                // std::vector<double> yAppBlockBuffer(POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK); // Temporary buffer for Y
                // std::vector<double> zAppBlockBuffer(POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK); // Temporary buffer for Z
                //
                // std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer> sdbufs;
                // // Path names must match those defined in the prototype in Sprint W1
                // sdbufs.emplace_back(m_imageFile.get(), "cartesianX", xAppBlockBuffer.data(), POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK, true, false, sizeof(double));
                // sdbufs.emplace_back(m_imageFile.get(), "cartesianY", yAppBlockBuffer.data(), POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK, true, false, sizeof(double));
                // sdbufs.emplace_back(m_imageFile.get(), "cartesianZ", zAppBlockBuffer.data(), POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK, true, false, sizeof(double));
                // // Before each writer.write() call, xAppBlockBuffer, yAppBlockBuffer, zAppBlockBuffer
                // // must be filled with data from the application's main point storage for the current block.
                ```
        * **Task W2.1.4**: Create an `e57::CompressedVectorWriter` associated with the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` and the prepared `SourceDestBuffer`s.
            * *Input*: `e57::CompressedVectorNode pointsNode`, `sdbufs`.
            * *Output*: `e57::CompressedVectorWriter writer`.
            * *Reference Code*: `e57::CompressedVectorWriter writer = pointsNode.writer(sdbufs);`
        * **Task W2.1.5**: Implement a loop to iterate through the application's point data in blocks. In each iteration:
            * Copy a block of XYZ data from the application's main point storage into the temporary C++ buffers (`xAppBlockBuffer`, `yAppBlockBuffer`, `zAppBlockBuffer`) linked to the `SourceDestBuffer`s. Determine the `actualPointsInBlock` for the current iteration (which might be less than `POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK` for the last block).
            * Call `writer.write(actualPointsInBlock)` to write the current block of points.
            * *Input*: Populated C++ block buffers, number of points in the current block.
            * *Output*: Data written to E57 binary section for the current block.
        * **Task W2.1.6**: After the loop, call `writer.close()` to finalize writing to the `CompressedVectorNode`. This action also ensures that the `CompressedVectorNode::childCount()` (which represents the number of point records) is correctly updated by `libE57Format` based on the total number of points written.
        * **Task W2.1.7**: Implement comprehensive error handling using `try-catch (e57::E57Exception& ex)` blocks for all `libE57Format` API calls involved in writing, including `pointsNode.writer()`, `writer.write()`, and `writer.close()`. Report errors appropriately.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: This file will contain the core implementation of the point writing logic, including buffer preparation and interaction with `CompressedVectorWriter`.
        * `src/e57writer_lib.h`: This header will declare the public methods of `E57WriterLib` for initiating point writing, potentially including helper structures for passing point data.
        * `libE57Format` headers (e.g., `e57/E57Foundation.h`): Essential for accessing classes like `CompressedVectorNode`, `CompressedVectorWriter`, and `SourceDestBuffer`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The `E57WriterLib` class provides a method that successfully writes a given set of XYZ coordinates (provided as `double`s) to the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` of a specified scan within an E57 file.
        2.  The `childCount()` of the `CompressedVectorNode`, when inspected after `writer.close()`, accurately matches the total number of input points provided to the `writePoints` method.
        3.  When the generated E57 file is read back (e.g., using `libE57Format`'s reader functionality or a separate E57 viewer), the XYZ coordinate values of the points precisely match the input application data, within the expected `double` precision.
        4.  The `e57::CompressedVectorWriter` object is correctly closed using `writer.close()` after all point data for a scan has been written.
        5.  Any `e57::E57Exception`s or other errors encountered during the point writing process (e.g., disk full, invalid node access) are caught, and informative error messages are reported through `E57WriterLib::getLastError()`.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W2.1.1**: Write a small, well-defined set of XYZ points (e.g., 3 to 10 points with easily verifiable coordinates like (1.0,2.0,3.0), (4.0,5.0,6.0)) to a new E57 file.
            * **Test Data**: A `std::vector<MyAppPointStruct>` (or equivalent) containing 3-10 points with known double-precision XYZ coordinates.
            * **Expected Result**: An E57 file is generated. Programmatic reading of this file (using `libE57Format`'s reader API in a test utility) confirms the correct number of points and that their XYZ coordinates match the input data precisely. Visual inspection in an external E57 viewer should also show the correct geometry.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test framework, custom C++ test utility using `libE57Format` for reading and verification, external E57 viewer (e.g., CloudCompare).
        * **Test Case W2.1.2**: Write a larger dataset of points (e.g., 10,000 to 100,000 points) to test the block-wise writing mechanism. Points can be randomly generated within a defined bounding box.
            * **Test Data**: A `std::vector` containing 50,000 points with randomly generated but valid double-precision XYZ coordinates.
            * **Expected Result**: An E57 file is generated. The `CompressedVectorNode::childCount()` in the output file matches 50,000. A statistical sampling of points read back from the file matches the corresponding input points. The writing process should demonstrate multiple calls to `writer.write()`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader).
        * **Test Case W2.1.3**: Attempt to write point data to a scan index that does not exist (e.g., if only one scan was defined in Sprint W1, try writing to scan index 1).
            * **Test Data**: Valid point data, an out-of-bounds scan index.
            * **Expected Result**: The `writePoints` method should fail gracefully. `E57WriterLib::getLastError()` should return a descriptive error message indicating an invalid scan index or inability to find the target `CompressedVectorNode`. No E57 file should be corrupted.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case W2.1.4**: Test writing zero points to a scan.
            * **Test Data**: An empty `std::vector` of points.
            * **Expected Result**: An E57 file is generated. The `CompressedVectorNode::childCount()` for the scan should be 0. The file should remain valid.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader).

### User Story W2.2: Calculate and Write Cartesian Bounds Metadata

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to automatically calculate the Cartesian bounding box (`cartesianBounds`) encompassing all XYZ point data being written to a specific scan, and then store this bounding box information accurately within the `Data3D` header of that scan in the E57 file,
* **So that** the generated E57 file contains precise spatial extent metadata for the point cloud, which is crucial for quick previews, efficient spatial indexing by other applications, and overall data integrity.
    * **Description**: The `cartesianBounds` element, a `StructureNode` child of the `Data3D` header, is vital for describing the spatial extents of a scan. It must contain six `FloatNode` children: `xMinimum`, `xMaximum`, `yMinimum`, `yMaximum`, `zMinimum`, and `zMaximum`. This user story requires the `E57WriterLib` to iterate through all the point data intended for a particular scan, determine the absolute minimum and maximum values for each X, Y, and Z coordinate, and then use these values to populate the `cartesianBounds` structure. This calculation and writing must occur before the `e57::ImageFile` is finalized and closed to ensure the metadata is correctly embedded.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W2.2.1**: During or immediately after the application provides the point data for a scan (as per Task W2.1.1), and before the `CompressedVectorWriter` is finalized, iterate through the entire set of input points for that scan to precisely determine the minimum and maximum values for the X, Y, and Z coordinates. Initialize min values to positive infinity and max values to negative infinity.
            * *Input*: The complete collection of application's point data (e.g., `std::vector<MyAppPointStruct>`) for the current scan.
            * *Output*: Six `double` values representing the calculated `minX_calc`, `maxX_calc`, `minY_calc`, `maxY_calc`, `minZ_calc`, `maxZ_calc`.
        * **Task W2.2.2**: After the point data has been written to the `CompressedVectorNode` using `writer.close()` (or just before closing the `ImageFile`), retrieve the `Data3D` `StructureNode` corresponding to the current `scanIndex`.
        * **Task W2.2.3**: Within this `Data3D` `StructureNode`, create a new child `StructureNode` named `cartesianBounds`. If a `cartesianBounds` node might already exist from a previous operation (though unlikely in a typical linear writing workflow), ensure it's correctly handled (e.g., replaced or updated).
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf` (from `m_imageFile.get()`), the target `Data3D` `StructureNode scanHeaderNode`.
            * *Output*: A new or accessed `cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` within `scanHeaderNode`.
            * *Reference Code (Creating or getting cartesianBounds structure)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode scanHeaderNode = ... (get the Data3D node for the current scan)
                // e57::StructureNode cartesianBoundsNode(m_imageFile.get());
                // scanHeaderNode.set("cartesianBounds", cartesianBoundsNode); // This creates/replaces the node
                ```
        * **Task W2.2.4**: Populate the `cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` by adding six child `FloatNode`s: `xMinimum`, `xMaximum`, `yMinimum`, `yMaximum`, `zMinimum`, and `zMaximum`. Set their values using the min/max coordinates calculated in Task W2.2.1. These `FloatNode`s must be specified with `e57::PrecisionDouble`.
            * *Input*: The calculated `minX_calc`, `maxX_calc`, etc., values, and the `cartesianBoundsNode`.
            * *Output*: The `cartesianBoundsNode` populated with the six required double-precision `FloatNode` children.
            * *Reference Code (Setting xMinimum, example for others)*:
                ```cpp
                // Assume minX_calc, maxX_calc, minY_calc, maxY_calc, minZ_calc, maxZ_calc are available
                // cartesianBoundsNode.set("xMinimum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), minX_calc, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // cartesianBoundsNode.set("xMaximum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), maxX_calc, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // cartesianBoundsNode.set("yMinimum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), minY_calc, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // cartesianBoundsNode.set("yMaximum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), maxY_calc, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // cartesianBoundsNode.set("zMinimum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), minZ_calc, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // cartesianBoundsNode.set("zMaximum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), maxZ_calc, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                ```
        * **Task W2.2.5**: Handle the edge case where zero points are written to a scan. In this scenario, `cartesianBounds` should still be created, but its min/max `FloatNode`s should be set to appropriate default values (e.g., all zeros, or min > max to indicate invalid/empty bounds as per E57 recommendations if applicable, though typically setting them to 0.0 is safe for zero points).
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: This file will house the logic for iterating through point data to calculate extents and for creating/populating the `cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` and its children `FloatNode`s using `libE57Format` API.
        * `libE57Format` headers: Necessary for `StructureNode` and `FloatNode` creation and manipulation.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  For every scan containing point data written to the E57 file, a `cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` is correctly created and populated as a child of the corresponding `Data3D` header.
        2.  The six child `FloatNode`s (`xMinimum`, `xMaximum`, `yMinimum`, `yMaximum`, `zMinimum`, `zMaximum`) within `cartesianBounds` accurately store the true minimum and maximum Cartesian coordinates of the point data written for that specific scan.
        3.  All six bounding coordinate values are stored as double-precision `FloatNode`s in the E57 file.
        4.  If a scan contains zero points, the `cartesianBounds` node is still present and contains default valid `FloatNode` values (e.g., all zeros).
        5.  The generated E57 file, including the `cartesianBounds` metadata, remains structurally valid and compliant with the ASTM E2807 standard.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W2.2.1**: Write a small set of points that form a simple, known bounding box (e.g., a cube extending from (1.0, 2.0, 3.0) to (11.0, 12.0, 13.0)).
            * **Test Data**: A `std::vector` of points defining a cube, for example, with vertices at (1,2,3), (11,2,3), (1,12,3), (1,2,13), etc.
            * **Expected Result**: The generated E57 file, when its XML portion is inspected (e.g., via `e57xmldump` or by reading with `libE57Format`), must show the `/data3D/0/cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` containing `xMinimum=1.0`, `xMaximum=11.0`, `yMinimum=2.0`, `yMaximum=12.0`, `zMinimum=3.0`, and `zMaximum=13.0`, all as double-precision floats.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (for reading back and verifying XML structure and node values), `e57xmldump` utility.
        * **Test Case W2.2.2**: Write a point cloud where the coordinate values are all negative or span across zero (e.g., from (-10,-20,-30) to (-1,-2,-3) or (-5,-5,-5) to (5,5,5)).
            * **Test Data**: Points with coordinates like `min_coord = (-10.5, -20.5, -30.5)` and `max_coord = (-0.5, -1.5, -2.5)`.
            * **Expected Result**: The `cartesianBounds` in the output E57 file must accurately reflect these negative extents (e.g., `xMinimum=-10.5`, `xMaximum=-0.5`).
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader).
        * **Test Case W2.2.3**: Test with writing only a single point to a scan (e.g., point at (7.7, 8.8, 9.9)).
            * **Test Data**: A `std::vector` containing a single point: (7.7, 8.8, 9.9).
            * **Expected Result**: The `cartesianBounds` should have `xMinimum`, `xMaximum` both equal to 7.7; `yMinimum`, `yMaximum` both equal to 8.8; and `zMinimum`, `zMaximum` both equal to 9.9.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader).
        * **Test Case W2.2.4**: Test writing zero points to a scan.
            * **Test Data**: An empty `std::vector` of points.
            * **Expected Result**: The `cartesianBounds` node should exist, and its min/max `FloatNode` children should be present with default values (e.g., all 0.0, or min > max if that's the chosen convention for empty bounds). The file must remain valid.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader).

## 3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)

## 4. References between Files

* **`src/e57writer_lib.h`** (Modified):
    * This header will be extended with method declarations like `writePoints(int scanIndex, const std::vector<PointDataType>& points)` where `PointDataType` is the application's representation of a 3D point (e.g., a struct with double x, y, z members).
    * Internal helper methods for calculating bounds might also be declared if not kept entirely private to the .cpp file.
* **`src/e57writer_lib.cpp`** (Modified):
    * This implementation file will see significant additions. It will implement the point writing loop using `e57::CompressedVectorWriter`.
    * It will include logic to iterate through the input point data to calculate the min/max for `cartesianBounds`.
    * It will use `libE57Format` API calls to create/access the `Data3D` node, create/access the `cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` within it, and populate the `xMinimum`, `xMaximum`, etc., `FloatNode` children.
* **`libE57Format` headers** (e.g., `e57/E57Foundation.h`, `e57/E57Exception.h`): These will be heavily used for all E57 node manipulation (`StructureNode`, `FloatNode`, `CompressedVectorNode`), writer objects (`CompressedVectorWriter`), and buffer definitions (`SourceDestBuffer`).
* **Application's Point Data Structures**: The `E57WriterLib` will need a clearly defined way to access XYZ coordinates from the application's internal point cloud storage (e.g., if the application uses `std::vector<float>` interleaved, or `std::vector<MyPointStruct>`). This interface needs to be stable.

**Data Flows (Conceptual for this Sprint):**
1.  The application (e.g., through a "Save As E57" command) collects the point data it wants to export for a particular scan. This data is likely in an application-specific format (e.g., `std::vector<MyPoint>`).
2.  The application calls a method in `E57WriterLib`, such as `E57WriterLib::addScanWithPoints(const std::string& scanName, const std::vector<MyPoint>& app_points)`.
3.  `E57WriterLib` (which already has an opened `e57::ImageFile* m_imageFile` from Sprint W1):
    a.  Creates a new `Data3D` structure (or gets the one for the current scan being written).
    b.  Iterates through `app_points` to calculate `minX, maxX, minY, maxY, minZ, maxZ`.
    c.  Creates/updates the `cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` within the `Data3D` node with these calculated values, ensuring they are stored as double-precision `FloatNode`s.
    d.  Retrieves the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` associated with this `Data3D` section (which has its prototype for XYZ doubles defined in Sprint W1).
    e.  Prepares `std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer> sdbufs`. For each buffer (e.g., for `cartesianX`):
        i.  Creates a temporary C++ `std::vector<double> temp_x_buffer` of a fixed block size (e.g., 10,000 elements).
        ii. Associates this `temp_x_buffer.data()` with the "cartesianX" path in the `SourceDestBuffer`.
    f.  Creates an `e57::CompressedVectorWriter writer = pointsNode.writer(sdbufs);`.
    g.  Enters a loop that processes `app_points` in blocks:
        i.  Copies data for the current block from `app_points` into `temp_x_buffer`, `temp_y_buffer`, `temp_z_buffer`.
        ii. Calls `writer.write(points_in_this_block);`.
    h.  After the loop, calls `writer.close();`. This finalizes the `CompressedVectorNode` and updates its internal record count.
4.  Later, when the user finalizes the E57 file (e.g., "Save and Close"), `E57WriterLib::closeImageFile()` will call `m_imageFile->close()`.

        * Re-open the generated E57 file using `libE57Format`'s reader API (or a test utility).
        * Verify that the `CompressedVectorNode::childCount()` matches the number of points written.
        * Read back a sample of points and assert their XYZ coordinates match the input.
        * Read back the `/data3D/0/cartesianBounds` node and assert its `xMinimum`, `xMaximum`, etc., values match the expected bounds of the input data.
    * **Relationships**: Tests `E57WriterLib`. Links against `libE57Format` for both writing (via `E57WriterLib`) and reading (for verification).

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint W2 is:
1.  The `E57WriterLib` can successfully take a list of XYZ coordinates (represented as `double`s, matching the prototype defined in Sprint W1) from the application and write them into the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` of a designated scan within an E57 file.
2.  The total number of point records written to the E57 file, as confirmed by inspecting the `CompressedVectorNode::childCount()` after the `CompressedVectorWriter` is closed, precisely matches the number of points provided by the application.
3.  The XYZ coordinate values stored within the binary section of the E57 file are accurate and identical (within `double` precision) to the input data provided by the application.
4.  For each scan containing written point data, the `cartesianBounds` `StructureNode` (child of the `Data3D` header) is correctly calculated based on the extents of the written points and populated with `xMinimum`, `xMaximum`, `yMinimum`, `yMaximum`, `zMinimum`, and `zMaximum` as double-precision `FloatNode`s.
5.  The E57 files generated, now including actual point data and their `cartesianBounds`, remain structurally valid and fully compliant with the ASTM E2807 standard. They can be successfully opened, and their point data and bounds metadata correctly read, by `libE57Format`'s reader API and at least one common third-party E57 viewer (e.g., CloudCompare).
6.  If the input point dataset is large, the `E57WriterLib` writes the data to the E57 file in manageable blocks to control memory usage during the writing process.
7.  Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented for all point data writing and bounds calculation operations, with clear error reporting if issues occur.

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Unit Tests (Google Test)**:
    * **XYZ Data Writing Correctness:**
        * Test writing a small, predefined set of points (e.g., 5-10 points) with known XYZ coordinates. Verify by reading the E57 file back:
            * Correct number of points (`CompressedVectorNode::childCount()`).
            * Exact match of XYZ coordinates for each point.
    * **Block-wise Writing:**
        * Test writing a larger dataset (e.g., 25,000 points, which might span multiple `writer.write()` calls if `POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK` is 10,000). Verify total point count and sample points.
    * **`cartesianBounds` Accuracy:**
        * For various input point distributions (e.g., all positive coordinates, all negative, mixed, a single point, a line of points, a flat plane of points), verify that the `xMinimum`, `xMaximum`, etc., values written to `cartesianBounds` are precisely calculated.
        * Test the edge case of writing zero points: `cartesianBounds` should exist and contain valid default values (e.g., all zeros).
    * **Error Handling:**
        * Test attempting to write points before an E57 file is properly initialized or after it's closed.
        * Test attempting to write to an invalid scan index.
        * Simulate disk full errors if possible (harder in unit tests, might be a manual/integration test).
* **File Validation (Automated and Manual)**:
    * **Automated Reader Verification:** All E57 files generated by unit tests *must* be re-opened and their contents (point count, sample points, `cartesianBounds`) programmatically verified using `libE57Format`'s reader API within the same test or a dedicated verification utility.
    * **External Viewer Check:** Manually open a selection of generated E57 files (e.g., one with few points, one with many points) in at least one reputable third-party E57 viewer (CloudCompare is a good free option; commercial viewers like ReCap or Cyclone if available) to visually confirm:
        * The point cloud geometry appears correct.
        * The software reports the correct number of points.
        * The software correctly interprets and displays or uses the `cartesianBounds` (e.g., for initial view framing).

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint W2:**
* Predefined C++ data structures (e.g., `std::vector<MyPointStruct>` or `std::vector<double>`) containing XYZ coordinates for testing:
    * A small set of 3-10 points with easily verifiable, hardcoded coordinates (e.g., (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), etc.).
    * A medium set of ~10,000 to ~100,000 points, possibly generated programmatically with coordinates within a known range (e.g., random points within a unit cube).
* Expected `cartesianBounds` (min/max X, Y, Z values) corresponding to each predefined input point set.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  **Sprint W1 Completion:** `E57WriterLib` can successfully create a new, valid E57 file with the basic XML structure, including `/data3D/0/points` `CompressedVectorNode` and its `prototype` defining `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ` as double-precision `FloatNode`s. The `ImageFile` is open and ready for writing point data.
    2.  **Application Data Format:** The application can provide point data to `E57WriterLib` as a collection of XYZ coordinates. For this sprint, it's assumed this data can be readily converted or accessed as `double` values for each coordinate to match the E57 prototype's double precision.
    3.  **Uncompressed Data Focus:** Only uncompressed XYZ point data is being written. The `codecs` element within the `CompressedVectorNode` will remain empty, implying default (uncompressed) data handling by `libE57Format` during writing.
    4.  **Single Scan Focus (for simplicity in initial data writing):** While the E57 structure might support multiple scans, the `writePoints` method for this sprint will primarily target writing to a single, specified scan index (e.g., index 0).
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  A functional `E57WriterLib` from Sprint W1, capable of initializing an E57 file and defining the basic scan and point prototype structure.
    2.  The `libE57Format` library (and its dependencies like Xerces-C) must be correctly integrated into the build system and fully functional for E57 file writing operations (Foundation API).
    3.  Standard C++ development environment: C++ compiler (supporting C++17 or as required by `libE57Format`), CMake, and vcpkg (or chosen package manager).
    4.  Google Test framework for unit testing.
    5.  For validation: An E57 reader capability, either by using `libE57Format`'s reader API within test utilities or by using external E57 viewing software.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-W2.1 (E57 Compliance)**: The E57 files generated, now containing XYZ point data and `cartesianBounds`, must strictly adhere to all relevant sections of the ASTM E2807 standard. No non-standard elements or structures should be introduced for these core components.
* **NFR-W2.2 (Data Integrity and Precision)**: The XYZ coordinate values written to the E57 file must be an exact representation of the source application data, with no loss of precision beyond that inherent in `double` floating-point representation. `cartesianBounds` must precisely reflect the extents of the written data.
* **NFR-W2.3 (Performance - Initial Writing)**: While full-scale performance optimization is deferred, the writing of moderately sized point clouds (e.g., up to 1 million points) should complete within a reasonable time frame (e.g., target < 30-60 seconds on benchmark hardware). The block-wise writing approach should prevent excessive RAM consumption during the writing process itself.
* **NFR-W2.4 (Resource Management - Writers and Buffers)**: `E57WriterLib` must ensure that all `libE57Format` resources, especially the `e57::CompressedVectorWriter` and any internally allocated data buffers for `SourceDestBuffer`s, are properly managed, closed, and released after writing is complete or if an error occurs during the process.

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint W2 represents a significant advancement in the E57 writing capability, moving from structural definition to the actual population of geometric point data. Successfully enabling the `E57WriterLib` to write XYZ coordinates and their corresponding `cartesianBounds` is a core milestone. This will allow the application to produce genuinely useful E57 files that accurately represent point cloud geometry and are interoperable with other software. This sprint builds directly on the foundational work of Sprint W1 and prepares for the inclusion of additional attributes like intensity and color in subsequent development efforts. The continued emphasis on data integrity, adherence to the E57 standard, and robust error handling during the writing process remains critical for delivering a high-quality feature.
