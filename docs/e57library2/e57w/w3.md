# Sprint W3 Backlog: E57 Writing - Intensity and Color Data to E57

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 1, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
**Sprint Goal:** To enhance `E57WriterLib` to optionally include intensity and RGB color data in the E57 file export. This involves extending the E57 point prototype to define these attributes, modifying the point writing process to include their data, and calculating and writing the corresponding `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` metadata to the `Data3D` header. The writer should also be configurable to include/exclude these attributes based on application settings or user choice.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the backlog items for Sprint W3 of Phase 1: "E57 Writing Capabilities," as detailed in the PRD `prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering`. Building upon the successful implementation of XYZ point data writing in Sprint W2, this sprint focuses on enriching the exported E57 files by adding support for optional point attributes: intensity and RGB color. Key activities include extending the E57 prototype definition within `E57WriterLib`, adapting the `CompressedVectorWriter` setup to handle these additional data streams, and ensuring that the `Data3D` header is correctly populated with `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` metadata. This will allow the application to produce more comprehensive E57 files that capture richer aspects of the scanned data.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story W3.1: Extend E57 Prototype for Optional Intensity Data

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to be able to optionally define an `intensity` field within the E57 point `prototype` (e.g., as a `FloatNode` for normalized values or a `ScaledIntegerNode` for raw/scaled sensor values),
* **So that** the E57 file structure is prepared to store per-point intensity information if it is available and selected for export.
    * **Description**: This story involves modifying the prototype creation logic in `E57WriterLib` (from Sprint W1). When intensity export is enabled, an additional node (e.g., `intensity`) must be added to the `prototype` `StructureNode`. The choice of `FloatNode` vs. `ScaledIntegerNode` for intensity will depend on how the application intends to store it (e.g., pre-normalized 0-1 float vs. integer values that require scale/offset).
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W3.1.1**: Modify the `E57WriterLib` method responsible for defining the point `prototype` (e.g., `definePointPrototype(bool includeIntensity, bool includeColor)`).
        * **Task W3.1.2**: If `includeIntensity` is true, add an `e57::Node` for intensity to the `prototype` `StructureNode`.
            * If storing normalized intensity (0.0-1.0): Use `e57::FloatNode(imf, 0.0, e57::PrecisionSingle, 0.0, 1.0)`.
            * If storing raw/scaled integer intensity (e.g., 16-bit): Use `e57::ScaledIntegerNode(imf, 0, 0, 65535, scale_factor, offset_value)`. The `scale_factor` and `offset_value` would be chosen to map the raw integer range to a meaningful physical or normalized range.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `prototype` `StructureNode`, boolean flag `includeIntensity`.
            * *Output*: `prototype` `StructureNode` potentially augmented with an `intensity` field.
            * *Reference Code (Adding intensity as FloatNode to prototype)*:
                ```cpp
                // In E57WriterLib, during prototype definition:
                // e57::StructureNode prototypeStructure = ...; // Get or create the prototype
                // if (exportIntensity) {
                //     // Example: Storing intensity as a normalized single-precision float (0.0 to 1.0)
                //     prototypeStructure.set("intensity", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0.0, e57::PrecisionSingle, 0.0, 1.0));
                // }
                ```
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Modification to prototype definition logic.
        * `libE57Format` headers: For `FloatNode`, `ScaledIntegerNode`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  When intensity export is enabled, the `prototype` `StructureNode` in the generated E57 file contains an `intensity` field of the specified E57 type (e.g., `FloatNode` or `ScaledIntegerNode`).
        2.  The `intensity` field definition includes appropriate attributes (e.g., `precision`, `minimum`, `maximum` for `FloatNode`; or `scale`, `offset`, `minimum`, `maximum` for `ScaledIntegerNode`).
        3.  If intensity export is disabled, the `intensity` field is not present in the prototype.
        4.  The E57 file remains structurally valid.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W3.1.1**: Generate an E57 file with intensity export enabled (e.g., as `FloatNode` single precision).
            * **Test Data**: Configuration flag to include intensity.
            * **Expected Result**: XML dump of the E57 file shows `/data3D/0/points/prototype/intensity` as a `FloatNode` with `precision="single"`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), `e57xmldump`.
        * **Test Case W3.1.2**: Generate an E57 file with intensity export enabled as `ScaledIntegerNode`.
            * **Test Data**: Configuration flag to include intensity, parameters for scaled integer (min, max, scale, offset).
            * **Expected Result**: XML dump shows `/data3D/0/points/prototype/intensity` as a `ScaledIntegerNode` with correct attributes.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.
        * **Test Case W3.1.3**: Generate an E57 file with intensity export disabled.
            * **Test Data**: Configuration flag to exclude intensity.
            * **Expected Result**: The `prototype` does not contain an `intensity` field.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.

### User Story W3.2: Extend E57 Prototype for Optional RGB Color Data

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to be able to optionally define `colorRed`, `colorGreen`, and `colorBlue` fields within the E57 point `prototype` (e.g., as `IntegerNode`s for 8-bit unsigned values 0-255),
* **So that** the E57 file structure is prepared to store per-point RGB color information if it is available and selected for export.
    * **Description**: Similar to intensity, this involves modifying the prototype creation logic. When color export is enabled, three new nodes (`colorRed`, `colorGreen`, `colorBlue`) are added to the `prototype`. For typical 8-bit color, these would be `IntegerNode`s with a range of 0-255. `ScaledIntegerNode` could also be used for higher bit-depth color if needed.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W3.2.1**: Modify the `E57WriterLib` method responsible for defining the point `prototype` (e.g., `definePointPrototype(bool includeIntensity, bool includeColor)`).
        * **Task W3.2.2**: If `includeColor` is true, add three `e57::Node`s for `colorRed`, `colorGreen`, `colorBlue` to the `prototype` `StructureNode`.
            * For 8-bit color (0-255): Use `e57::IntegerNode(imf, 0, 0, 255)` for each channel.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `prototype` `StructureNode`, boolean flag `includeColor`.
            * *Output*: `prototype` `StructureNode` potentially augmented with `colorRed`, `colorGreen`, `colorBlue` fields.
            * *Reference Code (Adding colorRed as IntegerNode to prototype)*:
                ```cpp
                // In E57WriterLib, during prototype definition:
                // e57::StructureNode prototypeStructure = ...; // Get or create the prototype
                // if (exportColor) {
                //     // Example: Storing 8-bit color components (0-255)
                //     prototypeStructure.set("colorRed",   e57::IntegerNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0, 0, 255));
                //     prototypeStructure.set("colorGreen", e57::IntegerNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0, 0, 255));
                //     prototypeStructure.set("colorBlue",  e57::IntegerNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0, 0, 255));
                // }
                ```
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Modification to prototype definition logic.
        * `libE57Format` headers: For `IntegerNode`, `ScaledIntegerNode`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  When color export is enabled, the `prototype` `StructureNode` in the generated E57 file contains `colorRed`, `colorGreen`, and `colorBlue` fields of the specified E57 type (e.g., `IntegerNode`).
        2.  The color field definitions include appropriate attributes (e.g., `minimum=0`, `maximum=255` for 8-bit `IntegerNode`).
        3.  If color export is disabled, these color fields are not present in the prototype.
        4.  The E57 file remains structurally valid.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W3.2.1**: Generate an E57 file with color export enabled (e.g., as 8-bit `IntegerNode`s).
            * **Test Data**: Configuration flag to include color.
            * **Expected Result**: XML dump shows `/data3D/0/points/prototype/colorRed`, `../colorGreen`, `../colorBlue` as `IntegerNode`s with min 0, max 255.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.
        * **Test Case W3.2.2**: Generate an E57 file with color export disabled.
            * **Test Data**: Configuration flag to exclude color.
            * **Expected Result**: The `prototype` does not contain `colorRed`, `colorGreen`, or `colorBlue` fields.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.

### User Story W3.3: Write Optional Intensity and Color Data to CompressedVector

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to write intensity and/or RGB color data (alongside XYZ coordinates) to the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` if these attributes are present in the application's input point data and the corresponding export options are enabled,
* **So that** E57 files can store richer point attributes beyond just geometry.
    * **Description**: This story builds upon User Story W2.1. The `writePoints` method in `E57WriterLib` needs to be extended. If intensity or color export is enabled, the `std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer> sdbufs` must be augmented with buffers for these additional attributes. The main writing loop will then populate these buffers from the application's point data and the `CompressedVectorWriter` will write them. The application's point data structure will need to provide this optional intensity/color information.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W3.3.1**: Modify the `E57WriterLib::writePoints(int scanIndex, const std::vector<AppPointType>& app_points, bool exportIntensity, bool exportColor)` method (or similar) to accept flags indicating whether to write intensity and color. `AppPointType` should now be a structure or class that can hold optional intensity (e.g., `float`) and color (e.g., `uint8_t r,g,b`).
        * **Task W3.3.2**: In `writePoints`, conditionally add `e57::SourceDestBuffer` entries to `sdbufs` for "intensity", "colorRed", "colorGreen", "colorBlue" if `exportIntensity` or `exportColor` are true, respectively, and if the prototype was defined to include them.
            * The C++ buffer types for these `SourceDestBuffer`s must match what the application provides and what the prototype expects (e.g., `float` for normalized intensity, `uint8_t` for 8-bit color channels).
            * *Input*: `m_imageFile.get()`, flags `exportIntensity`, `exportColor`, application point data.
            * *Output*: `sdbufs` configured for all attributes to be written.
            * *Reference Code (Adding intensity buffer to sdbufs for writing)*:
                ```cpp
                // In E57WriterLib::writePoints, after XYZ sdbufs are added:
                // std::vector<float> intensityBlockBuffer(POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK);
                // if (exportIntensity && /* prototype actually has intensity */ ) {
                //     sdbufs.emplace_back(m_imageFile.get(), "intensity", intensityBlockBuffer.data(), POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK, true, false, sizeof(float));
                // }
                // // Similar for colorRed, colorGreen, colorBlue using uint8_t buffers
                // std::vector<uint8_t> rBlockBuffer(POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK);
                // if (exportColor && /* prototype has colorRed */) {
                //    sdbufs.emplace_back(m_imageFile.get(), "colorRed", rBlockBuffer.data(), POINTS_PER_WRITE_BLOCK, true, false, sizeof(uint8_t));
                // }
                // // etc. for green and blue
                ```
        * **Task W3.3.3**: Modify the point data copying loop within `writePoints`. For each block of points:
            * If `exportIntensity` is true, copy intensity values from `app_points` to the `intensityBlockBuffer`.
            * If `exportColor` is true, copy R, G, B values from `app_points` to `rBlockBuffer`, `gBlockBuffer`, `bBlockBuffer`.
        * **Task W3.3.4**: Ensure the `e57::CompressedVectorWriter` is created with the fully populated `sdbufs` vector. The `writer.write()` call will then handle all configured attributes.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Core changes to `writePoints` method for handling additional attributes.
        * Application's point data structure: Must now be able to provide intensity and color.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  If intensity export is enabled and input data contains intensity, the generated E57 file includes intensity values for each point, matching the input.
        2.  If color export is enabled and input data contains color, the E57 file includes RGB values for each point, matching the input.
        3.  If an attribute (intensity or color) is not selected for export or not available in the input data, it is not written to the E57 file, and the file remains valid for the attributes that *are* written.
        4.  The `CompressedVectorNode::childCount()` correctly reflects the number of points written, irrespective of which optional attributes were included.
        5.  The E57 file is valid and data can be read back correctly by an E57 reader.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W3.3.1**: Write points with XYZ and Intensity (no color).
            * **Test Data**: Points with XYZ and float intensity values (e.g., 0.0-1.0). `exportIntensity=true`, `exportColor=false`.
            * **Expected Result**: E57 file contains XYZ and Intensity. Reading back confirms values. Prototype includes intensity but not color fields.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), E57 viewer.
        * **Test Case W3.3.2**: Write points with XYZ and RGB Color (no intensity).
            * **Test Data**: Points with XYZ and uint8_t RGB values. `exportIntensity=false`, `exportColor=true`.
            * **Expected Result**: E57 file contains XYZ and RGB. Reading back confirms values. Prototype includes color but not intensity fields.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), E57 viewer.
        * **Test Case W3.3.3**: Write points with XYZ, Intensity, and RGB Color.
            * **Test Data**: Points with all attributes. `exportIntensity=true`, `exportColor=true`.
            * **Expected Result**: E57 file contains all attributes. Reading back confirms values. Prototype includes all fields.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), E57 viewer.
        * **Test Case W3.3.4**: Write points with XYZ only (intensity and color export disabled).
            * **Test Data**: Points may or may not have intensity/color, but `exportIntensity=false`, `exportColor=false`.
            * **Expected Result**: E57 file contains only XYZ. Prototype reflects only XYZ.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), E57 viewer.

### User Story W3.4: Write IntensityLimits and ColorLimits Metadata

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to calculate the actual minimum and maximum values for intensity and each color channel from the point data being exported (if these attributes are included), and then write this information to the `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` `StructureNode`s within the `Data3D` header,
* **So that** the E57 file accurately describes the true range of these attribute values present in the scan, aiding other applications in proper normalization and display.
    * **Description**: Similar to `cartesianBounds` (Sprint W2), this involves iterating through the point data to find the min/max of actual intensity and R,G,B values being written. These computed limits are then used to populate the `intensityLimits` (with `intensityMinimum`, `intensityMaximum`) and `colorLimits` (with `colorRedMinimum`, `colorRedMaximum`, etc.) `StructureNode`s in the `Data3D` header. These nodes should contain `FloatNode`s or `IntegerNode`s as appropriate for the type of limits being stored (e.g., `FloatNode` for normalized intensity limits 0.0-1.0, `IntegerNode` for color limits 0-255).
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W3.4.1**: During or after the application provides point data (and before `ImageFile` is closed), if intensity is being exported, iterate through all input intensity values for the current scan to find the true minimum and maximum intensity.
            * *Input*: Application's intensity data for the scan.
            * *Output*: Calculated `minIntensity_actual`, `maxIntensity_actual`.
        * **Task W3.4.2**: Similarly, if color is being exported, find the min/max for each R, G, B channel.
            * *Input*: Application's R,G,B data for the scan.
            * *Output*: Calculated `minR_actual`, `maxR_actual`, etc.
        * **Task W3.4.3**: Retrieve the `Data3D` `StructureNode` for the current scan.
        * **Task W3.4.4**: If exporting intensity, create (if needed) an `intensityLimits` `StructureNode` under `Data3D`. Populate it with `intensityMinimum` and `intensityMaximum` `FloatNode`s (or `IntegerNode`/`ScaledIntegerNode` if storing raw limits that match the prototype) using the calculated actual min/max intensity values.
            * *Input*: `m_imageFile.get()`, `scanHeaderNode`, calculated intensity limits.
            * *Output*: `intensityLimits` node populated.
            * *Reference Code (Setting intensityMinimum as FloatNode)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode scanHeaderNode = ...;
                // if (exportIntensity) {
                //     e57::StructureNode intensityLimitsNode(m_imageFile.get());
                //     // Assuming minIntensity_actual, maxIntensity_actual are calculated floats (e.g. 0.0 to 1.0)
                //     intensityLimitsNode.set("intensityMinimum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), minIntensity_actual, e57::PrecisionSingle));
                //     intensityLimitsNode.set("intensityMaximum", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), maxIntensity_actual, e57::PrecisionSingle));
                //     scanHeaderNode.set("intensityLimits", intensityLimitsNode);
                // }
                ```
        * **Task W3.4.5**: If exporting color, create (if needed) a `colorLimits` `StructureNode` under `Data3D`. Populate it with `colorRedMinimum`, `colorRedMaximum`, etc., `IntegerNode`s (for 0-255 range) or appropriate `FloatNode`s/`ScaledIntegerNode`s using the calculated actual min/max R,G,B values.
            * *Input*: `m_imageFile.get()`, `scanHeaderNode`, calculated color channel limits.
            * *Output*: `colorLimits` node populated.
            * *Reference Code (Setting colorRedMinimum as IntegerNode)*:
                ```cpp
                // if (exportColor) {
                //     e57::StructureNode colorLimitsNode(m_imageFile.get());
                //     // Assuming minR_actual, maxR_actual are calculated uint8_t (0-255)
                //     colorLimitsNode.set("colorRedMinimum",   e57::IntegerNode(m_imageFile.get(), minR_actual, 0, 255));
                //     colorLimitsNode.set("colorRedMaximum",   e57::IntegerNode(m_imageFile.get(), maxR_actual, 0, 255));
                //     // ... similar for Green and Blue ...
                //     scanHeaderNode.set("colorLimits", colorLimitsNode);
                // }
                ```
        * **Task W3.4.6**: Handle cases where an attribute (intensity or color) is written but contains zero points, or all values are identical. Set appropriate min/max limits (e.g., min=max=value, or default range like 0-1 for intensity if all points have 0 intensity).
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Logic for calculating attribute limits and writing them to `Data3D` header.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  If intensity data is written, the `Data3D` header contains an `intensityLimits` `StructureNode` with `intensityMinimum` and `intensityMaximum` fields accurately reflecting the range of written intensity values.
        2.  If RGB color data is written, the `Data3D` header contains a `colorLimits` `StructureNode` with `colorRedMinimum/Maximum`, `colorGreenMinimum/Maximum`, `colorBlueMinimum/Maximum` fields accurately reflecting the range of written R,G,B values.
        3.  The E57 node types used for these limits (e.g., `FloatNode`, `IntegerNode`) are appropriate for the data being represented (e.g., `FloatNode` for normalized 0-1 intensity, `IntegerNode` for 0-255 color).
        4.  If an attribute is not written, its corresponding `Limits` node is not created.
        5.  The E57 file remains valid.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W3.4.1**: Write points with intensity values ranging from 0.1 to 0.9.
            * **Test Data**: Points with intensity values explicitly set to span a known range.
            * **Expected Result**: `intensityLimits` in E57 shows `intensityMinimum=0.1`, `intensityMaximum=0.9`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), `e57xmldump`.
        * **Test Case W3.4.2**: Write points with RGB colors where Red ranges 10-200, Green 50-150, Blue 0-255.
            * **Test Data**: Points with color channels spanning known ranges.
            * **Expected Result**: `colorLimits` reflects these exact min/max values for R, G, and B.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), `e57xmldump`.
        * **Test Case W3.4.3**: Write points where all intensity values are identical (e.g., all 0.5).
            * **Test Data**: All points have intensity = 0.5.
            * **Expected Result**: `intensityMinimum=0.5`, `intensityMaximum=0.5`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader).

### User Story W3.5 (Supporting): Enable Configuration for Exporting Intensity/Color

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib`'s primary export method(s) to accept boolean flags or a configuration object to specify whether intensity and/or RGB color data should be included in the E57 export,
* **So that** the export process can be controlled based on user choices made in the UI (e.g., checkboxes in an export dialog) or by application logic determining data availability.
    * **Description**: This story ensures that the `E57WriterLib` is flexible. The main method responsible for initiating the E57 writing process (likely involving prototype definition and point data writing) needs to be adaptable. It should take parameters that dictate whether to define intensity/color in the prototype and whether to attempt to write their data.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W3.5.1**: Review and refactor the main E57 export orchestration method in `E57WriterLib` (e.g., `bool E57WriterLib::exportScan(const ScanData& scan_data_to_export, const ExportOptions& options);`).
        * **Task W3.5.2**: The `ExportOptions` struct (or similar parameter mechanism) should include boolean members like `bool includeIntensity;` and `bool includeColor;`.
        * **Task W3.5.3**: The internal logic for defining the prototype (Tasks W3.1.2, W3.2.2), preparing `SourceDestBuffer`s (Task W3.3.2), and writing `intensityLimits`/`colorLimits` (Tasks W3.4.4, W3.4.5) must check these configuration flags before proceeding with operations related to intensity or color.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.h`: Definition of the export method signature and any configuration struct.
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Implementation using the configuration flags.
        * UI-level code (e.g., an export dialog in `MainWindow` - future sprint): Will be responsible for creating and passing these `ExportOptions` to `E57WriterLib`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  `E57WriterLib` provides a clear mechanism (e.g., method parameters or a settings object) to enable/disable the export of intensity data.
        2.  `E57WriterLib` provides a clear mechanism to enable/disable the export of RGB color data.
        3.  If intensity export is disabled via this mechanism, no intensity-related fields are added to the prototype, no intensity data is written, and no `intensityLimits` node is created, even if the input application data contains intensity.
        4.  If color export is disabled, no color-related fields are added to the prototype, no color data is written, and no `colorLimits` node is created, even if input data has color.
        5.  The E57 file is generated correctly based on the active export flags (e.g., XYZ only, XYZ+Intensity, XYZ+Color, or XYZ+Intensity+Color).
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W3.5.1**: Call the export method with `includeIntensity=true`, `includeColor=false`, using input data that has both intensity and color.
            * **Test Data**: App data with XYZ, I, RGB. Export options: include I, exclude RGB.
            * **Expected Result**: Output E57 contains XYZ and Intensity. Prototype and limits for intensity are present. No color prototype or data.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.
        * **Test Case W3.5.2**: Call export with `includeIntensity=false`, `includeColor=true`, using input data that has both.
            * **Test Data**: App data with XYZ, I, RGB. Export options: exclude I, include RGB.
            * **Expected Result**: Output E57 contains XYZ and RGB. Prototype and limits for color are present. No intensity prototype or data.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.
        * **Test Case W3.5.3**: Call export with both flags false, using input data that has both.
            * **Test Data**: App data with XYZ, I, RGB. Export options: exclude I, exclude RGB.
            * **Expected Result**: Output E57 contains only XYZ. No intensity or color in prototype or data.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.

## 3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)

## 4. References between Files

* **`src/e57writer_lib.h`** (Modified):
    * The point prototype definition logic will be expanded to conditionally add intensity and color fields.
    * The main data writing method signature will likely be updated to accept flags or an options struct to control attribute export.
    * May need new internal helper methods for calculating and writing `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits`.
* **`src/e57writer_lib.cpp`** (Modified):
    * Implementation of conditional prototype field creation.
    * Modification of `SourceDestBuffer` setup to include buffers for intensity and color based on export flags and data availability.
    * Updates to the point writing loop to copy intensity and color data to the respective `SourceDestBuffer`s.
    * Implementation of logic to calculate min/max for intensity and color channels from the input data.
    * Implementation of logic to create and populate `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` `StructureNode`s in the `Data3D` header.
* **Application Point Data Structure(s)**: The application's internal representation of point data (e.g., a struct or class passed to `E57WriterLib`) must now be capable of holding optional intensity (e.g., `float`) and RGB color (e.g., `uint8_t r,g,b`) values, along with flags indicating their presence.
* **`libE57Format` headers**: Continuously used for creating `FloatNode`, `IntegerNode`, `ScaledIntegerNode`, `StructureNode`, and for `CompressedVectorWriter` operations.
* **`tests/test_e57writer_lib.cpp`** (Modified): Unit tests will be significantly expanded.

**Data Flows (Conceptual for this Sprint):**
1.  Application determines which attributes (XYZ, Intensity, Color) to export based on data availability and user settings (UI options from future sprint).
2.  Application calls `E57WriterLib::exportScan(scanData, exportOptions)`.
3.  `E57WriterLib`:
    a.  Initializes E57 file and `Data3D` structure (if not already done for this scan).
    b.  Defines the `points` `CompressedVectorNode`'s `prototype` based on `exportOptions`, including XYZ, and conditionally `intensity` and `colorRed/Green/Blue` fields.
    c.  Iterates through `scanData` to calculate actual min/max for XYZ (from Sprint W2), and if `exportOptions.includeIntensity`, calculates min/max for intensity, and if `exportOptions.includeColor`, calculates min/max for R,G,B.
    d.  Writes `cartesianBounds` (from Sprint W2).
    e.  If `exportOptions.includeIntensity`, writes `intensityLimits` to `Data3D` header.
    f.  If `exportOptions.includeColor`, writes `colorLimits` to `Data3D` header.
    g.  Prepares `SourceDestBuffer`s for all attributes being exported.
    h.  Creates `CompressedVectorWriter`.
    i.  Loops through `scanData` in blocks, copying XYZ and conditionally intensity/color data to temporary C++ buffers associated with `SourceDestBuffer`s, then calls `writer.write()`.
    j.  Calls `writer.close()`.
4.  Application calls `E57WriterLib::closeImageFile()` to finalize the E57 file.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint W3 is:
1.  `E57WriterLib` can be configured to optionally include intensity and/or RGB color data in the E57 export.
2.  When enabled, the E57 point `prototype` is correctly extended with appropriate nodes (`FloatNode`, `IntegerNode`, or `ScaledIntegerNode`) for intensity and `colorRed/Green/Blue`.
3.  The point writing mechanism correctly writes intensity and/or RGB color data from the application's source to the E57 file, alongside XYZ coordinates.
4.  `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` `StructureNode`s are accurately calculated from the written data and populated in the `Data3D` header.
5.  The generated E57 files containing these optional attributes remain valid and can be correctly read by `libE57Format` and common third-party viewers, displaying the attributes as expected.
6.  If an attribute's export is disabled, or if the source data lacks that attribute, it is gracefully omitted from the E57 file without causing errors.

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Unit Tests (Google Test)**:
    * **Prototype Definition:** Test various combinations of `exportIntensity` and `exportColor` flags and verify the generated E57 prototype XML structure.
    * **Data Writing & Verification:** For each attribute combination (XYZ; XYZ+I; XYZ+C; XYZ+I+C):
        * Write a small set of points with known attribute values.
        * Read the E57 file back programmatically using `libE57Format`'s reader API.
        * Assert that the prototype is correct.
        * Assert that the `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` (if applicable) are correct.
        * Assert that the point data (XYZ, and I/C if written) matches the input values.
    * **Handling Missing Source Data:** Test scenarios where export for an attribute is enabled, but the input application data does not contain that attribute (e.g., `AppPoint.hasIntensity = false`). The writer should handle this gracefully (e.g., write default values like 0, or not include the attribute for those points if the E57 standard allows sparse attributes, though typically prototypes are fixed per `CompressedVectorNode`). For simplicity, writing default values (e.g., 0 for intensity, 0,0,0 for color) if the prototype field exists but source data is missing for a point might be a starting point.
* **File Validation (Automated and Manual)**:
    * All generated E57 files must be validated by reading them back with `libE57Format`.
    * Manually open representative E57 files (e.g., one with XYZ+I, one with XYZ+C, one with all) in external viewers (CloudCompare, etc.) to visually check if intensity and color are displayed correctly (if the viewer supports it).

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint W3:**
* Application-level point data structures that include optional intensity (e.g., `float` normalized 0-1) and RGB color (e.g., `uint8_t` per channel, 0-255).
* Predefined sets of such point data for testing:
    * Points with XYZ only.
    * Points with XYZ and intensity (various known intensity values).
    * Points with XYZ and RGB color (various known R,G,B values).
    * Points with XYZ, intensity, and RGB color.
* Expected `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` values for each test dataset.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  **Sprint W2 Completion:** `E57WriterLib` can successfully write XYZ point data and `cartesianBounds` to a valid E57 file.
    2.  **Application Data Availability:** The application can provide point data that includes optional intensity (e.g., as a `float`, potentially normalized 0-1) and optional RGB color (e.g., as `uint8_t` per channel, 0-255). Flags indicating the presence of these attributes per point might be needed if not all points have them.
    3.  **Prototype Field Types:**
        * Intensity will be written as either a `FloatNode` (e.g., single precision, range 0-1) or a `ScaledIntegerNode` (e.g., 16-bit raw, with scale/offset to map to a physical or normalized range). The PRD suggests `FloatNode` or `ScaledIntegerNode`. For initial simplicity, writing normalized `float` (0-1) to a `FloatNode` might be easiest.
        * RGB Color will be written as `IntegerNode`s (e.g., `minimum=0`, `maximum=255`) for 8-bit per channel color.
    4.  **Limits Representation:** `intensityLimits` will store min/max of the written (possibly normalized) intensity values. `colorLimits` will store min/max of the written R,G,B channel values (e.g., actual range within 0-255).
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  Functional `E57WriterLib` from Sprint W2.
    2.  `libE57Format` library correctly integrated.
    3.  Google Test framework.
    4.  (For validation) E57 reader capability and/or external E57 viewers.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-W3.1 (E57 Compliance)**: When intensity and color attributes and their limits are included, the generated E57 files must remain strictly compliant with ASTM E2807.
* **NFR-W3.2 (Data Integrity)**: Written intensity and color values must accurately represent the (potentially normalized) source application data. `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits` must accurately reflect the range of the data written.
* **NFR-W3.3 (Performance Impact)**: Adding intensity and color writing should have a predictable and acceptable impact on overall E57 export time. The increase in time should be primarily related to the additional data I/O and any necessary on-the-fly calculations (like min/max for limits).
* **NFR-W3.4 (Configurability)**: The choice to include/exclude intensity and color must be robustly handled, leading to correctly structured E57 files in all configurations.

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint W3 significantly enhances the E57 export capabilities of `E57WriterLib` by adding support for crucial point attributes: intensity and RGB color. This allows the application to generate much richer and more informative E57 files, increasing their utility for users and improving interoperability with other software that can leverage this additional data. The focus on correct prototype definition, accurate data writing, and proper metadata for attribute limits will ensure the quality and compliance of the output files.
