# Sprint W4 Backlog: E57 Writing - Metadata, Pose, Multiple Scans, and Testing

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 1, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
**Sprint Goal:** To finalize core E57 writing capabilities by implementing the writing of detailed scan metadata including scanner pose (`Data3D.pose`), supporting the export of multiple scans into a single E57 file, refining overall metadata population, and conducting comprehensive testing of all E57 export features developed in Sprints W1-W4.

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the backlog items for Sprint W4, the final sprint of Phase 1: "E57 Writing Capabilities," as detailed in the PRD `prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering`. Building on the successful implementation of writing XYZ coordinates, intensity, and color data in previous sprints, this sprint focuses on adding crucial metadata such as scanner pose, enabling the export of projects containing multiple scans into a single E57 file, and ensuring all relevant `E57Root` and `Data3D` header fields are correctly populated. A significant portion of this sprint will also be dedicated to comprehensive testing of all E57 writing functionalities to ensure robustness, compliance, and interoperability.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story W4.1: Write Scanner Pose Metadata to E57 `Data3D` Header

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to accept scanner pose information (translation and rotation quaternion) for each scan and write this data to the `pose` `StructureNode` within the respective `Data3D` header in the E57 file,
* **So that** the spatial orientation and position of each scan are accurately preserved, enabling correct alignment and georeferencing in other E57-compatible software.
    * **Description**: The `Data3D.pose` element is critical for defining the 6D transformation (3D position and 3D orientation) of a scan's local coordinate system relative to the E57 file's global coordinate system. This typically involves a `translation` `StructureNode` (with x, y, z `FloatNode`s) and a `rotation` `StructureNode` (with w, x, y, z `FloatNode`s for a quaternion). This story requires `E57WriterLib` to correctly create and populate these nested structures.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W4.1.1**: Extend the application's internal representation of a scan (e.g., `ScanData` struct passed to `E57WriterLib`) to include pose information: a 3D translation vector and a 4D rotation quaternion (w, x, y, z).
        * **Task W4.1.2**: Modify the `E57WriterLib` method responsible for writing `Data3D` header information (e.g., `writeScanHeaderMetadata(int scanIndex, const AppScanData& scanData)`).
        * **Task W4.1.3**: Within this method, if pose data is available in `scanData`, create a `pose` `StructureNode` as a child of the `Data3D` `StructureNode`.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `Data3D` `StructureNode scanHeaderNode`.
            * *Output*: `pose` `StructureNode` added to `scanHeaderNode`.
        * **Task W4.1.4**: Inside the `pose` `StructureNode`, create a `translation` `StructureNode`. Populate it with three child `FloatNode`s: `x`, `y`, `z` (double precision), using the translation values from `scanData`.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `poseNode`, translation vector (e.g., `double tx, ty, tz`).
            * *Output*: `translation` node populated.
            * *Reference Code (Setting translation)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode poseNode(m_imageFile.get());
                // scanHeaderNode.set("pose", poseNode);
                //
                // e57::StructureNode translationNode(m_imageFile.get());
                // translationNode.set("x", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), scanData.pose.translation.x, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // translationNode.set("y", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), scanData.pose.translation.y, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // translationNode.set("z", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), scanData.pose.translation.z, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // poseNode.set("translation", translationNode);
                ```
        * **Task W4.1.5**: Inside the `pose` `StructureNode`, create a `rotation` `StructureNode`. Populate it with four child `FloatNode`s: `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` (double precision), using the quaternion values from `scanData`.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `poseNode`, quaternion (e.g., `double qw, qx, qy, qz`).
            * *Output*: `rotation` node populated.
            * *Reference Code (Setting rotation quaternion)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode rotationNode(m_imageFile.get());
                // rotationNode.set("w", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), scanData.pose.rotation.w, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // rotationNode.set("x", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), scanData.pose.rotation.x, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // rotationNode.set("y", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), scanData.pose.rotation.y, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // rotationNode.set("z", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), scanData.pose.rotation.z, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // poseNode.set("rotation", rotationNode);
                ```
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Implementation of pose writing.
        * Application data structures holding scan information must be extended for pose.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The `Data3D` header for each written scan contains a `pose` `StructureNode`.
        2.  The `pose` node correctly contains `translation` and `rotation` child `StructureNode`s.
        3.  The `translation` node contains `x`, `y`, `z` `FloatNode`s (double precision) matching the input translation.
        4.  The `rotation` node contains `w`, `x`, `y`, `z` `FloatNode`s (double precision) matching the input quaternion.
        5.  If pose information is not provided by the application for a scan, the `pose` node may be omitted or populated with default identity transform values (e.g., (0,0,0) translation, (1,0,0,0) quaternion), as per E57 best practices or application requirements.
        6.  The generated E57 file remains valid and the pose can be correctly interpreted by other E57 software.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W4.1.1**: Write a scan with a known, non-identity pose (e.g., translation (1,2,3) and a 45-degree rotation around Z-axis).
            * **Test Data**: Application scan data with specific translation and quaternion values.
            * **Expected Result**: E57 file's `/data3D/0/pose` structure contains the correct translation and rotation values. Verify by reading back with `libE57Format` or inspecting with an E57 viewer that supports pose display/use.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), E57 viewer (e.g., CloudCompare).
        * **Test Case W4.1.2**: Write a scan where pose information is explicitly omitted by the application.
            * **Test Data**: Application scan data without pose.
            * **Expected Result**: The `pose` node in E57 is either absent or contains default identity values. The file is still valid.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `e57xmldump`.

### User Story W4.2: Support Writing Multiple Scans to a Single E57 File

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to support writing data from multiple distinct scans (each with its own points, prototype, bounds, pose, etc.) into the `/data3D` `VectorNode` of a single E57 file,
* **So that** projects comprising multiple scan setups can be exported as a single, cohesive E57 file.
    * **Description**: This involves extending the `E57WriterLib` to manage a list of scans to be written. For each scan, a new `Data3D` `StructureNode` will be appended to the `/data3D` `VectorNode`. All previously developed writing logic (prototype, points, bounds, pose, limits) will then be applied to this specific `Data3D` entry.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W4.2.1**: Design `E57WriterLib`'s API to accept a collection of scans (e.g., `std::vector<AppScanData>`) or allow sequential calls to an `addScanDataAndPoints()` method for each scan.
        * **Task W4.2.2**: Ensure that before writing each scan's data, a new `Data3D` `StructureNode` is created and appended to the `/data3D` `VectorNode` in the E57 file.
            * *Reference Code (Looping to add multiple Data3D entries)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode rootNode = m_imageFile->root();
                // e57::VectorNode data3DNode = static_cast<e57::VectorNode>(rootNode.get("/data3D")); // Assuming /data3D was created in W1
                //
                // for (const auto& appScanData : listOfApplicationScans) {
                //     e57::StructureNode scanHeaderNode(m_imageFile.get()); // Create a new Data3D entry
                //     data3DNode.append(scanHeaderNode); // Add it to the /data3D vector
                //
                //     // Now populate this scanHeaderNode with its specific guid, name, pose,
                //     // cartesianBounds, points (with its prototype), intensityLimits, colorLimits etc.
                //     // based on appScanData.
                //     // ... (call methods developed in W1, W2, W3, W4.1 for this scanHeaderNode) ...
                // }
                ```
        * **Task W4.2.3**: Ensure all metadata (GUID, name, pose, bounds, limits) and point data (XYZ, intensity, color) are written specifically to the correct `Data3D` entry for each scan.
        * **Task W4.2.4**: The `scanIndex` parameter in existing methods like `writePoints(scanIndex, ...)` will now be crucial for targeting the correct `Data3D` child within the `/data3D` `VectorNode`.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Major logic changes to handle iterating through multiple scans and writing data/metadata to the appropriate `Data3D` child.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The application can export an E57 file containing two or more distinct `Data3D` scan sections.
        2.  Each `Data3D` section in the `/data3D` `VectorNode` has its own unique GUID, name, pose, `cartesianBounds`, `points` `CompressedVectorNode` (with its prototype), and optionally `intensityLimits` and `colorLimits`.
        3.  The point data and metadata for each scan are correctly associated with their respective `Data3D` entry.
        4.  The generated multi-scan E57 file is valid and can be read by software that supports multiple scans (e.g., CloudCompare, `libE57Format` reader).
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W4.2.1**: Export a project containing 3 scans. Scan 1: 1000 XYZ points. Scan 2: 500 XYZ+Intensity points. Scan 3: 200 XYZ+Color points. Each scan has a different pose and bounds.
            * **Test Data**: Application data representing three distinct scans with different attributes and poses.
            * **Expected Result**: A single E57 file is generated. Reading it back confirms:
                * `/data3D` `VectorNode` has 3 children.
                * Each child `Data3D` has the correct point count, attributes in its prototype, pose, and bounds matching the input for that scan.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), E57 viewer.

### User Story W4.3: Populate Remaining Essential E57 Metadata

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to populate other essential and recommended metadata fields in the `E57Root` and `Data3D` headers, such as `creationDateTime`, `e57LibraryVersion`, `sensorModel`, `acquisitionStart`, etc., if this information is available from the application,
* **So that** the generated E57 files are more descriptive, self-contained, and provide better context about the data's origin and nature.
    * **Description**: Beyond the core data, E57 allows for rich metadata. This story involves identifying which additional standard E57 fields (as per ASTM E2807) are relevant and can be sourced from the application, then implementing the logic to write them.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W4.3.1**: Identify a list of relevant optional metadata fields from the E57 standard for `E57Root` (e.g., `creationDateTime`, `e57LibraryVersion`) and `Data3D` (e.g., `description`, `sensorVendor`, `sensorModel`, `sensorSerialNumber`, `acquisitionStart/End`, `temperature`, `relativeHumidity`, `atmosphericPressure`).
        * **Task W4.3.2**: Extend application data structures (e.g., `AppScanData`, global project info) to hold this metadata if it's not already available.
        * **Task W4.3.3**: Modify `E57WriterLib` to accept this additional metadata.
        * **Task W4.3.4**: Implement logic to write these fields as appropriate `StringNode`, `FloatNode`, `IntegerNode`, or `StructureNode` (e.g., for `DateTime`) children to the `E57Root` or respective `Data3D` `StructureNode`.
            * *Reference Code (Setting creationDateTime in E57Root)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode rootNode = m_imageFile->root();
                // e57::StructureNode creationDateTimeNode(m_imageFile.get());
                // // Assuming app_creation_gpstime is a double representing GPS time
                // creationDateTimeNode.set("dateTimeValue", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), app_creation_gpstime, e57::PrecisionDouble));
                // // Optionally add isAtomicClockReferenced if known
                // // creationDateTimeNode.set("isAtomicClockReferenced", e57::IntegerNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0)); // 0 for false, 1 for true
                // rootNode.set("creationDateTime", creationDateTimeNode);
                //
                // rootNode.set("e57LibraryVersion", e57::StringNode(m_imageFile.get(), "YourApp E57 Exporter v1.0 using libE57Format"));
                ```
            * *Reference Code (Setting sensorModel in Data3D)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode scanHeaderNode = ... ; // Get the Data3D node for the current scan
                // if (!appScanData.sensorModel.empty()) {
                //     scanHeaderNode.set("sensorModel", e57::StringNode(m_imageFile.get(), appScanData.sensorModel));
                // }
                ```
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Implementation for writing additional metadata fields.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The generated E57 file's `E57Root` contains `creationDateTime` and `e57LibraryVersion` fields.
        2.  Each `Data3D` header in the E57 file contains fields like `description`, `sensorModel`, `acquisitionStart` if this data was provided by the application.
        3.  All written metadata fields use the correct E57 node types and adhere to the standard.
        4.  The E57 file remains valid.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W4.3.1**: Export a scan providing all supported optional metadata.
            * **Test Data**: Application data including creation time, sensor model string, etc.
            * **Expected Result**: Generated E57 file, when inspected, shows all these metadata fields correctly populated in `E57Root` and `/data3D/0/`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), `e57xmldump`.

### User Story W4.4: Comprehensive Testing and Validation of E57 Writing

* **As a QA engineer/developer,**
* **I want** to perform comprehensive testing of all E57 writing functionalities developed in Sprints W1-W4, using diverse datasets and scenarios, including edge cases and error conditions,
* **So that** I can ensure the E57 export feature is robust, generates standard-compliant files, maintains data integrity, and handles errors gracefully.
    * **Description**: This is a crucial validation step. It involves creating a suite of test cases that cover all aspects of E57 writing: different combinations of attributes (XYZ, intensity, color), single vs. multiple scans, files with minimal vs. large numbers of points, and various metadata configurations. Output files must be validated for E57 compliance and data accuracy.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W4.4.1**: Develop a comprehensive test plan for E57 writing, covering:
            * Writing XYZ only.
            * Writing XYZ + Intensity.
            * Writing XYZ + Color.
            * Writing XYZ + Intensity + Color.
            * Writing single scan projects.
            * Writing multi-scan projects (e.g., 2-5 scans).
            * Writing scans with very few points (e.g., 0, 1, 3 points).
            * Writing scans with many points (e.g., 1M+ points).
            * Writing with and without pose information.
            * Writing with all optional metadata fields populated.
            * Testing different data precision settings for export if offered to user (e.g., single vs. double for coordinates - though current prototype is double).
        * **Task W4.4.2**: Create or acquire diverse input datasets (application's internal point cloud format) for these test scenarios.
        * **Task W4.4.3**: For each test case, execute the E57 export.
        * **Task W4.4.4**: Validate each generated E57 file:
            * **Compliance:** Check if it can be opened by `libE57Format` reader without error. Use official E57 validation tools if available.
            * **Data Accuracy:** Programmatically read back the E57 file and compare point data (XYZ, I, C), point counts, bounds, pose, and other metadata against the original input data.
            * **Interoperability:** Open the generated E57 files in at least two different major third-party E57 viewers/processors (e.g., CloudCompare, Autodesk ReCap, Leica Cyclone Viewer) and verify correct display of geometry, color, intensity (if supported by viewer), and metadata.
        * **Task W4.4.5**: Test error handling: e.g., attempt to write to a read-only location, simulate disk full (if possible), provide invalid input data to `E57WriterLib`.
        * **Task W4.4.6**: Document all test cases, procedures, input data, expected outcomes, and actual results.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `tests/test_e57writer_lib.cpp`: Will contain automated tests for these scenarios.
        * Test data generation scripts or source point cloud files.
        * External E57 validation tools/viewers.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  All E57 files generated across the test suite are fully compliant with ASTM E2807.
        2.  Data written to E57 files (points, attributes, metadata like pose, bounds, limits) is consistently accurate when compared to the source application data.
        3.  Exported E57 files are successfully imported and correctly interpreted by at least two major third-party E57 applications.
        4.  The E57 writing process handles edge cases (e.g., zero points, single point) correctly.
        5.  Error conditions during writing (e.g., disk full, invalid parameters) are handled gracefully with informative error messages.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W4.4.1**: Execute all defined test scenarios from Task W4.4.1.
            * **Test Data**: A suite of application-internal point cloud datasets representing each scenario.
            * **Expected Result**: All tests pass according to their specific criteria (compliance, data accuracy, interoperability).
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (reader), `e57xmldump`, CloudCompare, Autodesk ReCap (or other major E57 software).

    a.  Application calls `E57WriterLib::beginScan(scanName, scanGUID, scanPose, otherScanMetadata)`.
    b.  `E57WriterLib` creates a new `Data3D` entry in `/data3D`, writes its header including `pose` and other metadata.
    c.  Defines the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` prototype based on available attributes (XYZ, I, C).
    d.  Application calls `E57WriterLib::writePointsToCurrentScan(pointsData)`.
    e.  `E57WriterLib` calculates and writes `cartesianBounds`, `intensityLimits`, `colorLimits` for the current scan.
    f.  `E57WriterLib` writes the actual point data using `CompressedVectorWriter`.

2.  The application can export projects containing multiple scans into a single, valid E57 file, with each scan's data and metadata correctly stored in its respective `Data3D` section.
3.  Essential and common optional metadata fields (e.g., `creationDateTime`, `e57LibraryVersion` in `E57Root`; `description`, `sensorModel`, `acquisitionStart` in `Data3D`) are correctly populated in the generated E57 files if provided by the application.
4.  All E57 writing functionalities developed across Sprints W1-W4 are comprehensively tested, demonstrating robustness, E57 standard compliance, data integrity, and graceful error handling.
5.  Generated E57 files exhibit good interoperability with common third-party E57 viewing and processing software.

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Unit Tests (Google Test)**:
    * **Pose Writing:** Test with identity pose, simple translation, simple rotation, and combined translation/rotation. Verify by reading back and checking matrix/quaternion values.
    * **Multi-Scan Export:** Create test scenarios with 2-3 scans, each having different point counts, attributes, poses, and bounds. Verify that the `/data3D` vector has the correct number of children and that each child `Data3D` contains the correct data for its corresponding input scan.
    * **Metadata Population:** Test writing all targeted optional metadata fields. Read back the E57 XML to confirm their presence and correctness.
    * **Regression Testing:** Re-run key tests from Sprints W1-W3 to ensure no existing functionality was broken by the new additions.
* **Interoperability Testing**:
    * Select a representative set of E57 files generated by `E57WriterLib` (e.g., single scan XYZ, multi-scan XYZ+I+C with poses).
    * Attempt to open and inspect these files in at least two major third-party E57 applications (e.g., CloudCompare, Autodesk ReCap, Leica Cyclone Viewer, FARO Scene).
    * Verify that:
        * Files open without error.
        * Point counts are correct.
        * Geometry is displayed correctly.
        * Colors and intensities (if present and supported by viewer) are displayed.
        * Scan positions/orientations (poses) are correctly interpreted if the viewer supports this.
        * Key metadata is accessible.
* **Documentation Review**: Ensure internal developer documentation for `E57WriterLib` is updated to reflect new capabilities (pose, multi-scan, metadata).

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint W4:**
* Application-internal data structures representing multiple scans, each with:
    * XYZ point data (and optionally Intensity, RGB color).
    * Unique pose information (translation vector, rotation quaternion).
    * Specific metadata like scan name, description, sensor model, acquisition time.
* Expected E57 XML snippets or verification logic for poses and other metadata.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  **Sprints W1-W3 Completion:** `E57WriterLib` can successfully write XYZ, intensity, and color data, along with their respective bounds/limits, for a single scan to a valid E57 file.
    2.  **Application Data Model:** The application can provide per-scan pose information (translation and rotation) and other relevant metadata (creation time, sensor details) to `E57WriterLib`. It can also manage and provide data for multiple scans if a multi-scan export is initiated.
    3.  **Pose Representation:** Scanner pose is provided as a 3D translation vector and a 4D rotation quaternion (w,x,y,z).
    4.  **Default Metadata:** If certain optional metadata fields are not provided by the application, `E57WriterLib` will either omit them (if allowed by E57 standard) or write sensible default values (e.g., empty strings, zero timestamps).
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  Functional `E57WriterLib` from Sprint W3.
    2.  `libE57Format` library.
    3.  Google Test framework.
    4.  Access to third-party E57 viewing/processing software for interoperability testing.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-W4.1 (E57 Compliance & Interoperability)**: Generated multi-scan E57 files with poses and detailed metadata must be fully compliant with ASTM E2807 and demonstrate high interoperability with other major E57 software. This is a primary focus of the sprint.
* **NFR-W4.2 (Data Integrity)**: All written metadata, especially pose information, must be an exact representation of the source data.
* **NFR-W4.3 (Performance - Multi-Scan)**: Writing multiple scans should scale reasonably. The time to write a file with N scans should not be excessively greater than N times the average time to write a single scan of similar size (accounting for shared header/XML overhead).
* **NFR-W4.4 (Documentation)**: Internal developer documentation for `E57WriterLib` should be updated to cover pose handling, multi-scan export logic, and the newly supported metadata fields.

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint W4 culminates Phase 1 of E57 writing by adding critical metadata like scanner pose, enabling the export of complex multi-scan projects, and ensuring comprehensive metadata population. The strong emphasis on thorough testing and validation in this sprint is vital for delivering a robust, reliable, and interoperable E57 export feature. Successful completion will mean the application can produce high-quality, self-descriptive E57 files that are valuable to users and integrate well into broader 3D data workflows. This sprint finalizes the core E57 writing capabilities before potentially moving on to more advanced features or other development phases.
