Version: 1.0
Date: June 4, 2025
Associated PRD: E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
Sprint Goal: To enhance the PointCloudViewerWidget by enabling the rendering of point attributes (color and intensity) managed by the octree-LOD system, implementing point size attenuation for improved depth perception, and further optimizing the rendering pipeline for these new visual features.
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint R3 of Phase 2: "Advanced Rendering Features." Building on Sprints R1 and R2, which established an octree-based Level of Detail (LOD) system with screen-space error metrics and UI controls, this sprint focuses on enriching the visual output. Key objectives include rendering per-point color and intensity attributes (assuming the octree from R1 was designed to store them), implementing point size attenuation based on distance, and ensuring the rendering pipeline efficiently handles these new visual features.
2. User Stories
User Story R3.1: Render Per-Point Color Attributes

    As a developer,

    I want the PointCloudViewerWidget to render points using their individual RGB color attributes if available in the loaded point cloud data and stored in the octree,

    So that users can visualize the true color information of the scanned scene, providing a more realistic and informative representation.

        Description: This requires modifying the rendering pipeline to pass color data (e.g., as a vertex attribute) from the octree nodes to the GPU. The shader program will then use this per-vertex color instead of a uniform color for all points. This assumes that the OctreeNode (from R1/R2) stores or can access per-point color data.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R3.1.1: Verify/Ensure OctreeNode (from R1) and the point data structures can store and provide per-point RGB color attributes (e.g., 3 x uint8_t).

            Task R3.1.2: Modify the OpenGL vertex shader in PointCloudViewerWidget to accept a per-vertex color attribute (e.g., in vec3 vertexColor;).

            Task R3.1.3: Modify the fragment shader to use this incoming vertexColor to determine the fragColor.

            Task R3.1.4: Update the VBO setup and vertex attribute pointers in PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud (or the dynamic VBO update logic) to include color data. This means point data sent to the GPU will be interleaved (e.g., X,Y,Z,R,G,B).

            Task R3.1.5: Modify the rendering logic in paintGL to bind the VBO with color attributes and ensure the shader uses them.

            Task R3.1.6: Add a UI toggle (e.g., in MainWindow or a viewer settings panel) to switch between rendering with point colors and a user-selected uniform color.

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Major changes to shader code, VBO setup, vertex attribute pointers, and rendering logic.

            src/octree.h/.cpp (from R1): Confirmation that color data is accessible per point or per node.

            src/mainwindow.h/.cpp (potentially): UI control for toggling color rendering.

            OpenGL Shaders (likely embedded in pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp or separate .glsl files): Will be modified.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            If a point cloud contains color data, points are rendered in the PointCloudViewerWidget using their individual colors.

            If a point cloud does not contain color data, points are rendered using a default uniform color (as in R1/R2).

            A UI toggle allows the user to switch between per-point color rendering and uniform color rendering.

            The addition of color rendering does not cause a prohibitive drop in performance for moderately sized visible point sets.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R3.1.1: Load a point cloud file containing per-point RGB color data.

                Test Data: An E57 or LAS file with XYZ and RGB attributes (e.g., a colored scan of an object or scene).

                Expected Result: Points are displayed with their correct colors. Visual inspection should confirm color accuracy.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection, reference image/software if available.

            Test Case R3.1.2: Load a point cloud file without color data.

                Test Data: An E57 or LAS file with XYZ only.

                Expected Result: Points are displayed with a default uniform color.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

            Test Case R3.1.3: Toggle the color rendering UI control.

                Test Data: A point cloud with color data.

                Expected Result: Toggling the control switches the rendering between per-point colors and a uniform color.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection in the application.

User Story R3.2: Render Per-Point Intensity Attributes

    As a developer,

    I want the PointCloudViewerWidget to render points by mapping their intensity attributes to a grayscale color or by modulating a base color, if intensity is available,

    So that users can visualize surface reflectivity or other physical properties captured by the scanner's intensity readings.

        Description: Similar to color, this involves passing intensity data to the GPU. The fragment shader will then use the intensity value (typically normalized 0-1) to determine the point's brightness (grayscale) or modulate its color. This assumes OctreeNode stores/accesses intensity.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R3.2.1: Verify/Ensure OctreeNode (from R1) and point data structures can store and provide per-point intensity attributes (e.g., float, normalized 0-1).

            Task R3.2.2: Modify the OpenGL vertex shader to accept a per-vertex intensity attribute (e.g., in float vertexIntensity;) and pass it to the fragment shader.

            Task R3.2.3: Modify the fragment shader:

                If rendering grayscale: fragColor = vec4(vertexIntensity, vertexIntensity, vertexIntensity, 1.0);.

                If modulating point color (from US R3.1 or uniform color): fragColor = vec4(baseColor * vertexIntensity, 1.0);.

            Task R3.2.4: Update VBO setup and vertex attribute pointers in PointCloudViewerWidget to include intensity data (e.g., X,Y,Z,R,G,B,I).

            Task R3.2.5: Add a UI toggle (e.g., in MainWindow) to enable/disable intensity-based rendering and potentially switch between grayscale mapping and color modulation.

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Changes to shader code, VBO setup, vertex attribute pointers, rendering logic.

            src/octree.h/.cpp (from R1): Confirmation that intensity data is accessible.

            src/mainwindow.h/.cpp (potentially): UI control for intensity rendering.

            OpenGL Shaders: Will be modified.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            If a point cloud contains intensity data, points are rendered with varying brightness or modulated color based on their intensity values.

            If a point cloud does not contain intensity data, rendering falls back to color (if available) or uniform color.

            A UI toggle allows enabling/disabling intensity-based rendering.

            Intensity visualization is clear and helps differentiate points based on their intensity.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R3.2.1: Load a point cloud file containing per-point intensity data.

                Test Data: An E57 or LAS file with XYZ and Intensity attributes.

                Expected Result: Points are displayed in grayscale (or color modulated by intensity), with intensity variations clearly visible.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

            Test Case R3.2.2: Load a point cloud file without intensity data.

                Test Data: An E57 or LAS file with XYZ only (or XYZ+Color).

                Expected Result: Points are displayed using color (if available) or default uniform color. No intensity effect is visible.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

            Test Case R3.2.3: Toggle the intensity rendering UI control.

                Test Data: A point cloud with intensity data.

                Expected Result: Toggling the control switches the intensity visualization on/off.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection in the application.

User Story R3.3: Implement Point Size Attenuation Based on Distance

    As a developer,

    I want the PointCloudViewerWidget to render points with a size that attenuates (decreases) as their distance from the camera increases,

    So that the point cloud visualization has improved depth perception and distant points appear smaller and less overwhelming.

        Description: This involves calculating the distance of each point (or its octree node's center) from the camera in the vertex shader and adjusting gl_PointSize accordingly. This can be combined with the base point size set by the user or LOD system.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R3.3.1: Modify the vertex shader in PointCloudViewerWidget:

                Add a uniform for camera position (uniform vec3 cameraPosition_worldSpace;).

                Add a uniform for attenuation parameters (e.g., uniform float minPointSize; uniform float maxPointSize; uniform float attenuationFactor;).

                In main(), calculate the distance from the point's world-space position to cameraPosition_worldSpace.

                Calculate the desired point size based on distance and attenuation parameters. E.g., gl_PointSize = maxPointSize / (1.0 + distance * attenuationFactor); gl_PointSize = clamp(gl_PointSize, minPointSize, maxPointSize);.

                This calculated size can then be combined with the existing pointSize uniform (e.g., gl_PointSize = basePointSize * attenuationValue;).

            Task R3.3.2: In PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL(), pass the camera's world-space position and attenuation parameters as uniforms to the shader.

            Task R3.3.3: Add UI controls (e.g., in MainWindow or a viewer settings panel) to enable/disable point size attenuation and adjust its parameters (e.g., min/max size, attenuation factor/aggressiveness).

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Changes to vertex shader code, uniform setup in paintGL.

            src/mainwindow.h/.cpp (potentially): UI controls for point size attenuation.

            OpenGL Shaders: Vertex shader will be modified.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Points farther from the camera are rendered smaller than points closer to the camera.

            The point size attenuation effect is visually smooth and enhances depth perception.

            A UI control allows enabling/disabling point size attenuation.

            Users can adjust attenuation parameters (e.g., min/max point size, strength of attenuation).

            The default point size (from LOD or user setting) still influences the base size before attenuation.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R3.3.1: Load a point cloud with significant depth (e.g., a long plane or corridor).

                Test Data: A point cloud dataset extending far from the camera.

                Expected Result: Visually confirm that distant points appear smaller than near points. Panning and zooming should show point sizes changing dynamically and appropriately with distance.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

            Test Case R3.3.2: Toggle the "Enable Point Size Attenuation" UI control.

                Test Data: Any point cloud.

                Expected Result: When enabled, distance-based attenuation is active. When disabled, points are rendered at a more uniform size (possibly still affected by LOD's base point size).

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

            Test Case R3.3.3: Adjust attenuation parameters via UI.

                Test Data: Any point cloud.

                Expected Result: Changes to min/max size or attenuation factor are reflected in the rendered point sizes.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

Data Flows (Conceptual for this Sprint):

    Loading: PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud(points_with_attributes) builds/populates the Octree. Point attributes (color, intensity) are stored alongside XYZ coordinates.

    Rendering (paintGL in PointCloudViewerWidget):
    a.  LOD system (from R1/R2) determines the set of points/nodes to render.
    b.  For each visible point:
    i.  Vertex data (X,Y,Z, and if enabled: R,G,B, Intensity) is sent to the vertex shader.
    ii. Vertex Shader:
    1.  Transforms XYZ to clip space.
    2.  Calculates distance to camera.
    3.  If point size attenuation is enabled, computes gl_PointSize based on distance and attenuation uniforms. Otherwise, uses base point size.
    4.  Passes color and/or intensity attributes to the fragment shader.
    iii. Fragment Shader:
    1.  If color rendering enabled: Uses incoming per-vertex color.
    2.  Else if intensity rendering enabled: Calculates grayscale or modulates a base color using incoming intensity.
    3.  Else: Uses a uniform color.
    4.  Outputs final fragColor.
    c.  UI controls in MainWindow update corresponding member variables in PointCloudViewerWidget (e.g., m_renderWithColor, m_renderWithIntensity, m_attenuationEnabled, attenuation parameters), which are then used by the shaders or rendering logic.

6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint R3 is:

    PointCloudViewerWidget can render points using their individual color attributes if present and enabled.

    PointCloudViewerWidget can render points using their individual intensity attributes (as grayscale or modulated color) if present and enabled.

    PointCloudViewerWidget implements point size attenuation based on distance from the camera.

    UI controls are available to toggle attribute rendering (color, intensity) and point size attenuation, and to adjust attenuation parameters.

    The rendering of attributes and point size attenuation integrates correctly with the existing LOD system (from R1/R2).

    The application remains stable and performant when these new visual features are active.

7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:

    Unit Tests (Google Test):

        Shader Logic: If possible, unit test shader logic by providing specific inputs (vertex attributes, uniforms) and verifying outputs (e.g., final color, point size). This might involve mocking parts of the OpenGL pipeline or using a shader testing framework if available.

        Attribute Handling: Test PointCloudViewerWidget's logic for preparing VBOs with different combinations of attributes (XYZ, XYZ+C, XYZ+I, XYZ+C+I).

        Parameter Updates: Verify that PointCloudViewerWidget correctly updates its internal state and shader uniforms when UI control slots are called.

    Integration Tests (within PointCloudViewerWidget and MainWindow context):

        Load point clouds with various attribute combinations (XYZ only, XYZ+Color, XYZ+Intensity, XYZ+Color+Intensity).

        Visual Verification:

            Confirm correct display of colors and intensities.

            Verify point size attenuation effect is visually correct and enhances depth perception.

            Test all UI controls: toggle color rendering, toggle intensity rendering, toggle attenuation, adjust attenuation parameters. Observe that the viewer updates accordingly.

        Performance Measurement:

            Measure FPS with attribute rendering and attenuation enabled/disabled. Identify any significant performance regressions.

        Interaction with LOD: Ensure that attribute rendering and point size attenuation work correctly in conjunction with the LOD system (e.g., sampled points from coarse LOD nodes should still have correct attributes rendered).

    Code Reviews: Review shader code, VBO management, and UI integration for attribute rendering and point size control.

Test Data Requirements for Sprint R3:

    Point cloud files (E57, LAS) with different attribute combinations:

        XYZ only.

        XYZ + RGB Color.

        XYZ + Intensity.

        XYZ + RGB Color + Intensity.

    Point clouds with known color patterns or intensity gradients for easy visual verification.

    Large point clouds with significant depth to test point size attenuation effectively.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint R1 & R2 Completion: A functional octree-LOD system is in place, capable of culling and selecting points/nodes based on view frustum and screen-space error. PointCloudViewerWidget can render points from this system and has UI controls for basic LOD parameters.

        Attribute Storage: The octree and point data structures (from R1) are capable of storing or efficiently accessing per-point color (e.g., 3 x uint8_t) and intensity (e.g., float normalized 0-1) if these attributes were present in the loaded file.

        OpenGL Capabilities: The target OpenGL version supports programmable shaders (vertex and fragment) and gl_PointSize control from the vertex shader.

        Performance Trade-offs: Adding per-vertex attributes and more complex shader logic might have a performance cost, which should be monitored and kept reasonable.

    Dependencies:

        Completed octree-LOD system from Sprints R1 and R2.

        Functional PointCloudViewerWidget and MainWindow from previous sprints.

        Qt 6 framework (Core, GUI, OpenGL, Widgets).

        C++ compiler with C++17 support.

        Google Test framework for unit testing.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    NFR-R3.1 (Performance - Attribute Rendering): Enabling color or intensity rendering should not cause an excessive drop in FPS for typical scenes compared to rendering with uniform color. The impact should be proportional to the added data transfer and shader complexity.

    NFR-R3.2 (Performance - Point Size Attenuation): Point size attenuation calculations in the vertex shader should be efficient and not become a bottleneck.

    NFR-R3.3 (Visual Quality - Attributes): Rendered colors should accurately reflect the source data. Intensity visualization should effectively convey variations.

    NFR-R3.4 (Visual Quality - Attenuation): Point size attenuation should look natural and improve depth cues without causing points to become invisibly small too quickly or remain too large at a distance.

    NFR-R3.5 (Usability - UI Controls): UI controls for new rendering features should be intuitive and provide immediate visual feedback.

10. Conclusion

Sprint R3 focuses on significantly improving the visual richness and perceptual quality of the point cloud rendering in PointCloudViewerWidget. By enabling the display of color and intensity attributes and implementing distance-based point size attenuation, the visualization will become more informative, realistic, and easier to interpret. These features, built upon the efficient LOD system from previous sprints, will provide users with a powerful tool for exploring complex 3D point cloud data.
