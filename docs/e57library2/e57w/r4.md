Sprint R4 Backlog: Advanced Rendering - Point Splatting/Impostors and Basic Lighting

Version: 1.0
Date: June 4, 2025
Associated PRD: E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
Sprint Goal: To further enhance the visual fidelity and performance of the PointCloudViewerWidget by implementing point splatting/impostors for rendering coarse Level of Detail (LOD) octree nodes, introducing a basic lighting model to improve depth perception and surface definition, and providing UI controls for these new visual features.
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint R4 of Phase 2: "Advanced Rendering Features." Sprints R1-R3 established an octree-based LOD system with screen-space error metrics, attribute rendering (color/intensity), and point size attenuation. Sprint R4 aims to significantly improve the visual representation of distant or dense point cloud regions by rendering coarse LOD octree nodes as point splats (textured quads) instead of just sampled points. Additionally, a basic lighting model will be introduced to enhance the 3D appearance of the rendered scene. UI controls will be added to manage these new features.
2. User Stories
User Story R4.1: Implement Point Splatting for Coarse LOD Octree Nodes

    As a developer,

    I want the PointCloudViewerWidget to render coarse LOD octree nodes as screen-aligned quads (point splats), textured or colored to represent the aggregate properties of the points within those nodes,

    So that distant or dense areas of the point cloud are visualized more cohesively and with better performance than rendering many individual small points or a sparse sample.

        Description: When the LOD system (from R2) determines that an octree node should be rendered at a coarse level (e.g., its screen-space error is below a threshold), instead of rendering a subset of individual points, this story involves rendering a single quad (or a few quads) at the node's position. The size of the quad would be related to the node's projected screen size. The quad could be textured (e.g., with a soft dot or a pre-rendered impostor) and colored using an average color/intensity of the points within the node.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R4.1.1: Design the splat rendering strategy. Options:

                Screen-aligned quads generated in a geometry shader or via instancing.

                Quads sized based on the projected size of the octree node's AABB.

            Task R4.1.2: Modify OctreeNode (if necessary) to store or compute aggregate attribute data (e.g., average color, average intensity, dominant normal if available/calculable) for its points. This might be done during octree construction or on-the-fly.

            Task R4.1.3: Create/Modify OpenGL shaders for splat rendering:

                Vertex Shader: Takes a single point (e.g., octree node center) as input. May expand this point to a quad using a geometry shader or by outputting multiple vertices for instanced rendering. Calculates splat size based on distance/projection. Passes aggregate attributes (color, intensity) to the fragment shader.

                Fragment Shader: Renders the splat. This could involve:

                    Applying a soft circular texture (alpha-blended).

                    Using the aggregate color/intensity.

                    Potentially faking some lighting/shading.

            Task R4.1.4: Update PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL() rendering logic:

                When a node is selected for coarse LOD rendering (by screen-space error metric), instead of rendering sampled points (from R2), render it as a splat using the new shader.

                This will involve binding a different VBO/VAO or reconfiguring vertex attributes for splat data (e.g., node center, aggregate attributes).

            Task R4.1.5: Implement a mechanism to switch between rendering individual points (for high-detail nodes) and splats (for coarse-detail nodes) within the same rendering pass, or manage separate passes.

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Major changes to rendering logic, shader management, and VBO/VAO setup for splats.

            src/octree.h/.cpp (from R1/R2): May need modifications to store/calculate aggregate node properties.

            OpenGL Shaders (new or modified): Vertex, Fragment, and potentially Geometry shaders for splatting.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Octree nodes determined to be "coarse" by the LOD system are rendered as screen-aligned quads (splats).

            Splat size is appropriately determined by the node's projected screen size or distance.

            Splats are colored/textured to represent the underlying points (e.g., average color/intensity).

            Visual appearance of distant/dense point cloud regions is improved (more solid, less noisy) compared to rendering sampled points.

            Performance is maintained or improved for scenes where many nodes are rendered as splats.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R4.1.1: Load a very large and dense point cloud. Zoom out.

                Test Data: Point cloud with 10M+ points.

                Expected Result: Distant parts of the cloud are rendered as splats, appearing more continuous and less like sparse individual points. FPS should be interactive.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection, FPS counter, graphics debugger (e.g., RenderDoc) to inspect geometry.

            Test Case R4.1.2: Compare rendering with splatting vs. R2's refined point selection for coarse LOD.

                Test Data: Various large point clouds.

                Expected Result: Splatting provides a visually denser and often more appealing representation for distant areas at comparable or better performance.

                Testing Tool: Visual comparison, FPS counter.

            Test Case R4.1.3: Verify splat coloring/texturing.

                Test Data: Point cloud with distinct color/intensity regions.

                Expected Result: Splats in different regions reflect the average color/intensity of the points they represent.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

User Story R4.2: Implement Basic Lighting Model

    As a developer,

    I want the PointCloudViewerWidget to apply a basic lighting model (e.g., directional light) to the rendered points or splats,

    So that the 3D shape and structure of the point cloud are better perceived by the user.

        Description: This involves calculating or assigning normals to the rendered geometry (points or splats) and then applying a simple lighting equation (e.g., Lambertian diffuse) in the fragment shader. If per-point normals are not available from the input data, normals for splats might be camera-facing, or a global "ambient occlusion" like effect could be simulated.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R4.2.1: Decide on normal handling strategy:

                If point data includes normals: Pass them as vertex attributes.

                If rendering splats: Normals can be screen-aligned (camera-facing), or derived from an average normal of points in the octree node if calculable and stored.

                For individual points without normals (if splatting is disabled or for high-detail): They might appear self-illuminated or use a very simplified shading.

            Task R4.2.2: Modify OpenGL shaders:

                Vertex Shader: Pass normal attribute (if available) to fragment shader. Transform normal to view space.

                Fragment Shader:

                    Add uniforms for light properties (e.g., uniform vec3 lightDirection_viewSpace;, uniform vec3 lightColor;, uniform float ambientIntensity;).

                    Implement a basic lighting calculation (e.g., diffuse: max(dot(normal_viewSpace, lightDirection_viewSpace), 0.0) * lightColor).

                    Combine calculated light with point/splat base color and ambient light.

            Task R4.2.3: In PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL(), set the light property uniforms.

            Task R4.2.4: If normals are not part of the input point data, investigate simple ways to estimate them for splats or apply a technique that doesn't strictly require per-primitive normals (e.g., Eye-Dome Lighting as a more advanced alternative, or simply modulating brightness by depth). For R4, camera-facing normals for splats is a reasonable start.

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Shader modifications, uniform setup for lighting.

            src/octree.h/.cpp (from R1/R2): May need to store/calculate average normals if that strategy is chosen.

            OpenGL Shaders: Vertex and Fragment shaders will be modified for lighting.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Rendered points/splats are affected by a configurable light source, showing variations in brightness based on their orientation relative to the light (if normals are used) or other lighting cues.

            The 3D appearance of the point cloud is enhanced, making shapes and surfaces more discernible.

            Lighting can be toggled on/off via UI control.

            Basic light parameters (e.g., direction, color) can be adjusted.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R4.2.1: Load a point cloud representing a 3D object with clear surfaces (e.g., a CAD model converted to points, or a scan of a building).

                Test Data: Point cloud with discernible geometric shapes.

                Expected Result: With lighting enabled, surfaces facing the light appear brighter, and those facing away appear darker, enhancing the 3D form. Rotating the model or light direction should change the shading.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

            Test Case R4.2.2: Test lighting with splats vs. individual points.

                Test Data: Point cloud viewable with both fine (points) and coarse (splats) LOD.

                Expected Result: Lighting effect is applied consistently to both representations.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

            Test Case R4.2.3: Toggle lighting UI controls.

                Test Data: Any point cloud.

                Expected Result: Enabling/disabling lighting changes the rendering accordingly. Adjusting light parameters (direction, color) updates the scene's appearance.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection.

User Story R4.3: Implement UI Controls for Splatting and Lighting

    As a user,

    I want UI controls to toggle point splatting for coarse LOD and to enable/disable lighting and adjust basic light parameters,

    So that I can customize the visual representation and performance characteristics of the point cloud viewer.

        Description: This involves adding new UI elements to MainWindow (or a viewer settings panel) to control the features implemented in US R4.1 and R4.2.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R4.3.1: Add UI elements to MainWindow:

                A checkbox: "Enable Point Splatting for LOD".

                A checkbox: "Enable Lighting".

                If lighting is enabled: Controls for light direction (e.g., 2-3 sliders for X,Y,Z direction vector components), light color (color picker), and ambient intensity (slider).

            Task R4.3.2: Add public slots in PointCloudViewerWidget to receive updates from these UI controls (e.g., setSplattingEnabled(bool), setLightingEnabled(bool), setLightDirection(QVector3D), setLightColor(QColor), setAmbientIntensity(float)).

            Task R4.3.3: Connect UI element signals to these new slots in PointCloudViewerWidget.

            Task R4.3.4: PointCloudViewerWidget uses these settings to alter its rendering behavior (choosing splat vs. point rendering path, enabling/disabling lighting calculations in shaders, updating light uniforms).

        References between Files:

            src/mainwindow.h/.cpp: Addition of UI controls and signal/slot connections.

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h/.cpp: Addition of public slots and member variables for new visual feature parameters; logic to use these parameters in rendering.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            UI controls allow toggling point splatting for coarse LOD nodes.

            UI controls allow toggling basic lighting.

            If lighting is enabled, UI controls allow adjustment of light direction, color, and ambient intensity.

            Changes in UI controls are reflected in the PointCloudViewerWidget's rendering.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R4.3.1: Manipulate all new UI controls.

                Test Data: A large, complex point cloud.

                Expected Result:

                    Toggling "Enable Point Splatting" changes how distant/coarse LOD parts of the cloud are rendered.

                    Toggling "Enable Lighting" turns lighting effects on/off.

                    Adjusting light direction sliders changes the apparent direction of the light source in the scene.

                    Changing light color updates the color of the light.

                    Adjusting ambient intensity changes the overall brightness of unlit areas.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection in the application.

    PointCloudViewerWidget can render coarse LOD octree nodes as point splats, improving visual cohesion for distant/dense areas.

    A basic lighting model is implemented, enhancing the 3D perception of the rendered point cloud.

    UI controls allow users to toggle splatting, toggle lighting, and adjust basic light parameters.

    Splatting and lighting features integrate correctly with the existing LOD system and attribute rendering.

    The application maintains stability and reasonable performance with the new visual enhancements.

7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:

    Unit Tests (Google Test):

        Aggregate Attribute Calculation: If OctreeNode is modified to store aggregate attributes, test these calculations.

        Shader Logic (Splatting & Lighting): Test shader components if possible, or focus on integration tests for visual output.

    Integration Tests (within PointCloudViewerWidget and MainWindow context):

        Load various large point clouds with and without color/intensity attributes.

        Visual Verification:

            Confirm splats are rendered correctly for distant/coarse LOD nodes.

            Verify splat appearance (size, color/texture, blending).

            Confirm lighting effects on both individual points and splats.

            Test all new UI controls and observe their effect on the rendering.

        Performance Measurement:

            Measure FPS with splatting and lighting enabled/disabled. Compare with R3 performance.

            Profile rendering loop to identify any new bottlenecks.

        Interaction with other features: Ensure splatting and lighting work correctly with existing LOD controls, attribute rendering toggles, and point size attenuation.

    Code Reviews: Review splatting implementation, shader modifications for splatting and lighting, and UI integration.

Test Data Requirements for Sprint R4:

    Large, dense point clouds to effectively test splatting.

    Point clouds with clear geometric structures to test lighting effects.

    Point clouds with color and intensity data to test how these attributes are represented on splats.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint R1-R3 Completion: A functional octree-LOD system with screen-space error, refined point selection, attribute rendering (color/intensity), point size attenuation, and UI controls for these features is in place.

        Attribute Access: The octree/point data structures can provide necessary information for splats (e.g., node center, aggregate color/intensity).

        Normal Data (for Lighting): If per-point normals are required for high-quality lighting, their availability in input data is a factor. If not available, a fallback strategy (e.g., camera-facing normals for splats, simplified shading) will be used.

        OpenGL Capabilities: Target OpenGL version supports features needed for splatting (e.g., geometry shaders or instancing, texture mapping, blending) and programmable lighting.

    Dependencies:

        Completed LOD and attribute rendering system from Sprints R1-R3.

        Functional PointCloudViewerWidget and MainWindow.

        Qt 6 framework.

        C++ compiler with C++17 support.

        Google Test framework.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    NFR-R4.1 (Performance - Splatting): Rendering coarse LOD nodes as splats should generally offer better performance (or comparable performance with improved visual density) than rendering many individual points or a sparse sample for those nodes.

    NFR-R4.2 (Performance - Lighting): The basic lighting model should not introduce a severe performance penalty. FPS should remain interactive.

    NFR-R4.3 (Visual Quality - Splatting): Splats should provide a visually coherent and appealing representation of distant/dense point cloud regions, reducing the "point soup" effect.

    NFR-R4.4 (Visual Quality - Lighting): Lighting should noticeably improve the 3D appearance and depth perception of the scene.

    NFR-R4.5 (Configurability): Users should have clear and effective control over splatting and lighting features.

10. Conclusion

Sprint R4 aims to significantly enhance the visual quality and realism of the point cloud rendering. By introducing point splatting for coarse LOD nodes, the viewer will be able to represent large, distant, or dense areas more effectively. The addition of a basic lighting model will further improve the 3D perception of the scene. These features, combined with user controls, will provide a more powerful and customizable visualization experience, making the PointCloudViewerWidget a more capable tool for point cloud analysis.
