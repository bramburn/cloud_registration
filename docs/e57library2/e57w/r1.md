# Sprint R1 Backlog: Advanced Rendering - Foundational LOD System (Octree & Basic Culling)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** June 1, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
**Sprint Goal:** To implement a foundational Level of Detail (LOD) system for the `PointCloudViewerWidget` by designing and integrating an octree-based spatial subdivision structure for loaded point clouds, and enabling basic view-frustum and distance-based culling to improve rendering performance with large datasets.

## 1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint R1 of Phase 2: "Advanced Rendering Features," as outlined in the PRD `prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering`. The primary objective of this sprint is to address performance limitations when visualizing large point clouds by introducing a Level of Detail (LOD) system. This will involve creating an octree to spatially organize the point cloud data, modifying the `PointCloudViewerWidget` to utilize this octree for rendering, and implementing initial culling strategies (view-frustum and distance-based) to selectively render points based on their relevance to the current camera view. This foundational LOD system is crucial for enabling smoother interaction and visualization of substantial datasets.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story R1.1: Octree-Based Spatial Subdivision of Point Clouds

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** to implement an octree data structure that can efficiently partition and store loaded point cloud data (XYZ coordinates, and optionally color/intensity),
* **So that** the application has a hierarchical spatial index necessary for implementing Level of Detail rendering and efficient culling operations.
    * **Description**: This story focuses on creating the core data structure for LOD. When a point cloud is loaded (e.g., from an E57 file via `E57ParserLib`), it needs to be inserted into an octree. Each node in the octree will represent a spatial cell and may store points that fall within it or delegate to child nodes if the point density is too high. The octree should store not just XYZ coordinates but also associated attributes like color and intensity if available.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task R1.1.1**: Design the octree node structure. Each node should store its spatial bounds, a list of points (or indices to points) if it's a leaf node, and pointers/references to its eight children. It should also potentially store aggregate information like average color/intensity if needed for coarser LOD representations.
            * *Input*: Point cloud data characteristics (XYZ, color, intensity).
            * *Output*: C++ class/struct definition for `OctreeNode`.
        * **Task R1.1.2**: Implement the octree construction algorithm. This will involve:
            * Determining the root bounding box encompassing all points.
            * Recursively subdividing space and distributing points to child nodes until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum points per leaf node).
            * *Input*: `std::vector<PointFullData>` (or similar structure holding point attributes).
            * *Output*: A fully constructed octree.
            * *Reference Code (Conceptual Octree Insertion)*:
                ```cpp
                // class OctreeNode {
                // public:
                //     AxisAlignedBoundingBox bounds;
                //     std::vector<PointFullData> points; // Points in this leaf node
                //     std::unique_ptr<OctreeNode> children[8];
                //     bool isLeaf = true;
                //     int depth;

                //     void insert(const PointFullData& point, int maxDepth, int maxPointsPerNode) {
                //         if (!bounds.contains(point.x, point.y, point.z)) return;

                //         if (isLeaf) {
                //             if (points.size() < maxPointsPerNode || depth >= maxDepth) {
                //                 points.push_back(point);
                //             } else { // Subdivide
                //                 isLeaf = false;
                //                 createChildren(); // Create 8 child nodes with subdivided bounds
                //                 // Distribute existing points and the new point to children
                //                 for (const auto& p : points) {
                //                     distributeToChild(p);
                //                 }
                //                 points.clear(); // Clear points from this internal node
                //                 distributeToChild(point);
                //             }
                //         } else { // Internal node
                //             distributeToChild(point);
                //         }
                //     }
                //     // ... other methods: createChildren, distributeToChild, getChildIndexForPoint ...
                // };
                ```
        * **Task R1.1.3**: Integrate octree generation into the point cloud loading pipeline in `PointCloudViewerWidget` (or a dedicated data manager class). The octree should be built after points are loaded and transformed.
        * **Task R1.1.4**: Ensure the octree can store XYZ coordinates, and if available, color (RGB) and intensity (float) for each point.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h` / `src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp`: Will likely host or manage the octree instance. May require a new class `Octree.h/.cpp`.
        * Data structures for points (e.g., `PointFullData` from `E57ParserLib.h` if reused, or a new internal viewer point structure).
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  An octree structure is successfully generated from a loaded point cloud.
        2.  The octree correctly partitions the 3D space occupied by the point cloud.
        3.  Points are correctly distributed to the appropriate leaf nodes of the octree.
        4.  The octree stores XYZ coordinates and, if present in the input, color and intensity data for each point.
        5.  The octree generation process is reasonably efficient for typical point cloud sizes (e.g., completes within a few seconds for a 1-5 million point cloud).
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case R1.1.1**: Generate an octree for a small, known point cloud (e.g., 100 points forming a cube).
            * **Test Data**: A `std::vector` of 100 points with XYZ coordinates.
            * **Expected Result**: Octree is created. Verify programmatically that points are in the correct leaf nodes based on their coordinates and octree subdivision logic. Check octree depth and leaf node point counts.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, debugger.
        * **Test Case R1.1.2**: Generate an octree for a point cloud with color and intensity.
            * **Test Data**: Points with XYZ, color, and intensity attributes.
            * **Expected Result**: Octree stores all attributes correctly for points in leaf nodes.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, debugger.
        * **Test Case R1.1.3**: Measure octree build time for a moderately sized point cloud (e.g., 1 million points).
            * **Test Data**: A point cloud of 1M points.
            * **Expected Result**: Build time is within acceptable limits (e.g., < 5 seconds).
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test with timing, profiler.

### User Story R1.2: Implement Octree-Based Rendering with View-Frustum Culling

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** to modify the `PointCloudViewerWidget`'s rendering pipeline to traverse the octree and render only the points contained in octree nodes that intersect the current camera's view frustum,
* **So that** rendering performance is improved by not processing or sending points to the GPU that are outside the visible area.
    * **Description**: This involves changing `PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL()` to query the octree instead of rendering a flat list of points. A recursive traversal of the octree will be implemented. For each octree node, a test will determine if its bounding box intersects with the camera's view frustum. If it does, its child nodes are processed, or if it's a leaf node, its points are rendered.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task R1.2.1**: Implement a method in `OctreeNode` or a helper class to test for intersection between an octree node's Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) and the camera's view frustum (defined by its projection and view matrices).
            * *Input*: Node's AABB, camera view matrix, camera projection matrix.
            * *Output*: Boolean indicating intersection.
        * **Task R1.2.2**: Modify `PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL()` (or a new rendering method called by it):
            * Instead of iterating through `m_pointData`, start a recursive traversal of the octree from the root node.
            * For each internal node, check if its AABB intersects the view frustum. If yes, recursively call for its children.
            * For each leaf node, if its AABB intersects the view frustum, retrieve its points and prepare them for rendering.
        * **Task R1.2.3**: Aggregate all visible points (or point batches from visible leaf nodes) and send them to the GPU for rendering using the existing shader program. Consider dynamic VBO updates or batching strategies.
            * *Input*: Points from visible leaf nodes.
            * *Output*: Points rendered on screen.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp`: Major changes to `paintGL()` or introduction of new rendering methods.
        * `Octree.h/.cpp` (if created): Will contain octree traversal and intersection test logic.
        * OpenGL rendering pipeline (shaders, VBOs).
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The `PointCloudViewerWidget` renders points by traversing the octree.
        2.  Points in octree nodes whose bounding boxes are entirely outside the camera's view frustum are not rendered.
        3.  Visual output correctly displays only the points that should be visible within the current view.
        4.  A noticeable improvement in rendering frame rate (FPS) is observed when viewing a small portion of a very large point cloud compared to rendering the entire dataset without culling.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case R1.2.1**: Load a large point cloud that extends significantly beyond the initial camera view.
            * **Test Data**: A point cloud of ~5M points forming a large plane or volume.
            * **Expected Result**: Only the portion of the point cloud within the camera's view frustum is rendered. Panning/rotating the camera reveals new sections while culling others. FPS should be higher than rendering all 5M points.
            * **Testing Tool**: Visual inspection in the application, FPS counter, debugger to verify number of points sent for rendering.
        * **Test Case R1.2.2**: Programmatically verify culling by setting up a camera view where specific octree nodes should be culled.
            * **Test Data**: A point cloud with a known octree structure. Specific camera parameters.
            * **Expected Result**: Debug output or internal counters confirm that nodes outside the frustum are not processed for rendering.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, debugger.

### User Story R1.3: Implement Basic Distance-Based Level of Detail (LOD)

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the octree-based rendering in `PointCloudViewerWidget` to implement a simple distance-based LOD, where fewer points are rendered for octree nodes that are farther from the camera,
* **So that** rendering performance is further improved for large scenes by reducing the geometric complexity of distant objects.
    * **Description**: This story adds another layer of optimization on top of view-frustum culling. During the octree traversal, if an octree node is visible (intersects frustum) but is far from the camera, the system might decide to render a simplified representation of its contents (e.g., a subset of its points, or stop recursion at a coarser octree level for that branch).
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task R1.3.1**: Define a distance metric (e.g., distance from camera to node's center or closest point of its AABB).
        * **Task R1.3.2**: Establish LOD thresholds. For example, if a node is beyond `distance_LOD1`, render only 50% of its points; if beyond `distance_LOD2`, render 10% or stop subdividing further and render points from the current coarser node.
        * **Task R1.3.3**: Modify the octree traversal rendering logic:
            * If a node is visible and within the closest LOD distance, render all its points (if leaf) or continue recursion.
            * If a node is visible but beyond an LOD threshold, either:
                * Stop recursion at this node and render a subset of points from this node (if it's an internal node that also stores a sample of points, or if leaf nodes store points in a way that allows subsampling).
                * Or, if it's a leaf node, render a randomly selected subset of its points.
            * *Input*: Octree node, camera position, LOD distance thresholds.
            * *Output*: Potentially fewer points rendered for distant nodes.
        * **Task R1.3.4**: For this initial implementation, a simple strategy could be to stop octree traversal at a certain depth for distant nodes, effectively rendering points from coarser octree cells.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp`: Modifications to the octree traversal and point selection logic.
        * `Octree.h/.cpp` (if created): May need methods to get node distance or a representative point sample.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  When viewing a large point cloud, distant parts of the cloud are rendered with visibly fewer points (or coarser representation) compared to closer parts.
        2.  The transition between LOD levels is noticeable but not overly distracting for this initial implementation.
        3.  A measurable improvement in rendering FPS is observed for scenes with significant depth complexity compared to view-frustum culling alone.
        4.  The LOD mechanism is controllable (e.g., can be toggled or its aggressiveness adjusted via parameters for testing).
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case R1.3.1**: Load a deep scene (e.g., a long corridor or a large landscape).
            * **Test Data**: A point cloud with significant depth variation.
            * **Expected Result**: Visually confirm that distant sections are less dense. FPS should be higher when looking down the corridor (many distant points) compared to rendering all points at full detail.
            * **Testing Tool**: Visual inspection, FPS counter.
        * **Test Case R1.3.2**: Compare rendering performance with LOD enabled vs. disabled (or only view-frustum culling).
            * **Test Data**: A large, deep point cloud.
            * **Expected Result**: Measurable FPS increase with distance-based LOD enabled.
            * **Testing Tool**: FPS counter, profiler.

## 3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)

## 4. References between Files

* **`src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h`** (Modified):
    * Will need members to store the octree root.
    * May need new private methods for octree traversal, frustum culling logic, and LOD point selection.
    * Existing rendering methods (`paintGL`) will be significantly refactored.
* **`src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp`** (Modified):
    * Implementation of octree building upon point cloud load.
    * New rendering loop that traverses the octree.
    * Implementation of AABB-frustum intersection tests.
    * Implementation of distance calculation and LOD decision logic.
    * Modifications to how point data is prepared and sent to OpenGL buffers (dynamic batching based on visible/LOD-selected points).
* **`Octree.h` / `Octree.cpp`** (New Files, potentially):
    * Class definition for `OctreeNode` and the `Octree` manager.
    * Methods for insertion, subdivision, querying visible nodes, AABB tests.
* **OpenGL Shaders** (in `pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp` or separate .glsl files): Unlikely to change for this sprint, as the focus is on *which* points are rendered, not *how* individual points are rendered.
* **Application's Point Data Structures**: The octree will need to store or reference the application's point data (XYZ, and optionally color, intensity).

**Data Flows (Conceptual for this Sprint):**
1.  **Loading:** `PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud(points)` is called.
    a.  The raw `points` data is processed to build an `Octree` instance.
    b.  The `Octree` stores points in its leaf nodes, possibly with attributes.
2.  **Rendering (`paintGL`):**
    a.  Camera view and projection matrices are updated.
    b.  The view frustum is derived from these matrices.
    c.  A recursive function `renderOctreeNode(node, frustum, cameraPosition)` is called starting with the octree root.
    d.  Inside `renderOctreeNode`:
        i.  Test `node.bounds` against `frustum`. If no intersection, return.
        ii. Calculate distance from `cameraPosition` to `node.bounds`.
        iii. Based on distance and LOD thresholds:
            1.  If node is too far and coarse LOD is selected: render a simplified representation of `node` (e.g., if it's an internal node, render a subset of points it contains, or stop recursion).
            2.  If node is a leaf node and within acceptable LOD: add `node.points` to a list of points to be rendered.
            3.  If node is an internal node and not culled by LOD: recursively call `renderOctreeNode` for its children.
    e.  After traversal, the aggregated list of visible points is uploaded to a dynamic VBO and drawn.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint R1 is:
1.  An octree is successfully generated from loaded point cloud data, storing XYZ and available attributes (color, intensity).
2.  The `PointCloudViewerWidget` renders point clouds by traversing the octree.
3.  View-frustum culling is implemented, and points outside the camera's view are not rendered.
4.  A basic distance-based LOD mechanism is implemented, rendering fewer points for distant octree nodes.
5.  A noticeable improvement in rendering performance (FPS) is observed when viewing large datasets, especially when zoomed in or viewing sections with significant depth.
6.  The application remains stable during navigation and interaction with LOD-enabled point clouds.

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Unit Tests (Google Test)**:
    * **Octree Construction:** Verify correct partitioning, point distribution, and attribute storage for various small point clouds. Test edge cases (empty cloud, single point, co-planar points).
    * **AABB-Frustum Intersection:** Test the intersection logic with known AABBs and frustum planes.
    * **LOD Logic:** Test the distance calculation and LOD selection logic with mock camera positions and node distances.
* **Integration Tests (within `PointCloudViewerWidget` context):**
    * Load various point clouds (small, large, dense, sparse, deep scenes).
    * **Visual Verification:** Manually navigate the scene. Confirm that points outside the view are culled. Confirm that distant points appear less dense or are represented by coarser octree cells.
    * **Performance Measurement:** Implement an FPS counter in the viewer. Measure FPS with and without LOD / frustum culling on benchmark datasets. Compare the number of points actually rendered per frame.
    * **Stress Testing:** Load extremely large point clouds (if available or generatable) to test the limits of the LOD system and identify performance bottlenecks or stability issues.
* **Code Reviews**: Review octree implementation, rendering loop modifications, and culling/LOD logic for correctness and efficiency.

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint R1:**
* Small point clouds with known geometry for octree structure verification (e.g., 10-1000 points).
* Medium point clouds (e.g., 500k - 2M points) for initial performance testing of culling and LOD.
* Large point clouds (e.g., 5M - 20M+ points, if feasible to load parts of them) to demonstrate significant performance benefits of LOD.
* Point clouds with varying spatial distributions (e.g., dense clusters, sparse areas, long linear features, deep scenes).
* Point clouds with XYZ, color, and intensity attributes.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  The application has a functional E57/LAS parser (`E57ParserLib` or similar) capable of loading point cloud data (XYZ, color, intensity) into an in-memory representation (e.g., `std::vector<PointFullData>`).
    2.  The `PointCloudViewerWidget` has a working OpenGL rendering setup capable of drawing points from a VBO (as per existing `pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp` structure).
    3.  Basic 3D math utilities (vector operations, matrix transformations, AABB calculations) are available or can be implemented.
    4.  For this initial LOD implementation, perfect visual quality or seamless LOD transitions are secondary to achieving noticeable performance gains. More advanced LOD techniques (e.g., screen-space error metrics, point splatting, impostors) are out of scope for this sprint.
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  A working point cloud loading mechanism (from E57/LAS files).
    2.  `PointCloudViewerWidget` with its existing OpenGL setup.
    3.  Qt 6 framework (Core, GUI, OpenGL).
    4.  C++ compiler with C++17 support.
    5.  Google Test framework for unit testing.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-R1.1 (Performance - Rendering FPS)**: With LOD enabled, the `PointCloudViewerWidget` must maintain an interactive frame rate (target: >30 FPS, ideally >60 FPS) when navigating typical large point clouds (e.g., 5-10 million points visible after culling/LOD) on target hardware.
* **NFR-R1.2 (Performance - Octree Build Time)**: The time taken to build the octree upon loading a new point cloud should be reasonable and not excessively prolong the overall file loading experience (e.g., target: octree build for 1M points in < 2-3 seconds).
* **NFR-R1.3 (Memory Usage - Octree)**: The octree data structure itself should have a manageable memory footprint, not significantly exceeding, for example, 20-50% of the raw point data size (trade-off between storage and query speed).
* **NFR-R1.4 (Visual Quality - LOD)**: While reducing detail, the LOD system should avoid overly aggressive culling that leads to a visually jarring or uninformative display for distant objects. The representation should still convey the general shape and presence of distant geometry.
* **NFR-R1.5 (Stability)**: The introduction of the octree and LOD rendering must not introduce new crashes or instability into the `PointCloudViewerWidget`, especially during dynamic camera movements or when loading diverse datasets.

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint R1 is a critical first step in enhancing the rendering capabilities of the `PointCloudViewerWidget`. Implementing a foundational octree-based LOD system with view-frustum and basic distance culling will directly address performance issues encountered with large point clouds. This will provide a significantly improved user experience by enabling smoother navigation and interaction. The successful completion of this sprint will lay the groundwork for more advanced rendering techniques and visualization features planned in subsequent sprints of Phase 2.
