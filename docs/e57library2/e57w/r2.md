Sprint R2 Backlog: Advanced Rendering - LOD Enhancements (Screen-Space Error & Refined Selection)

Version: 1.0
Date: June 4, 2025
Associated PRD: E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
Sprint Goal: To significantly enhance the Level of Detail (LOD) system in the PointCloudViewerWidget by implementing a screen-space error metric for more accurate LOD selection, refining how points are selected from coarse octree nodes, and providing UI controls for users to manage LOD behavior, thereby improving both rendering performance and visual fidelity for large point clouds.
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint R2 of Phase 2: "Advanced Rendering Features." Following the implementation of a foundational octree and basic culling in Sprint R1, this sprint aims to refine the LOD system. Key enhancements include adopting a screen-space error metric for determining LOD transitions, improving the visual representation of distant octree nodes by rendering a representative subset of points instead of all points from coarser nodes, and introducing UI elements to allow users to enable/disable LOD and adjust its sensitivity. These improvements will lead to a more perceptually consistent and performant visualization experience.
2. User Stories
User Story R2.1: Implement Screen-Space Error Metric for LOD Selection

    As a developer,

    I want to implement an LOD selection mechanism based on a screen-space error metric for octree nodes in the PointCloudViewerWidget,

    So that the decision to render a node at a coarser level or cull it is based on its projected visual impact on the screen, leading to more efficient and visually consistent rendering.

        Description: This involves calculating the projected size of an octree node's bounding box on the screen. If this projected size (or an error derived from it) is smaller than a defined threshold (e.g., a few pixels), the system will decide to stop octree traversal deeper into that branch and render a simplified representation of the current node, or cull it entirely if the error is very small. This is generally more effective than purely distance-based LOD.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R2.1.1: Design and implement a function to calculate the screen-space error for an OctreeNode. This typically involves:

                Projecting the 8 corners of the node's Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) onto the screen using the current Model-View-Projection (MVP) matrix.

                Determining the screen-space extent (e.g., pixel diameter or area) of the projected AABB.

                Comparing this extent against a configurable error threshold (e.g., maxScreenSpaceErrorInPixels).

                Input: OctreeNode's AABB, camera's MVP matrix, viewport dimensions.

                Output: A boolean indicating if the node's screen-space error is below the threshold, or the actual error value.

            Task R2.1.2: Modify the octree traversal logic in PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL() (or its rendering helper methods):

                Before recursively processing child nodes, calculate the current node's screen-space error.

                If the error is below a primary threshold, stop recursion for this branch. The node's content will be rendered using a simplified representation (see User Story R2.2).

                If the error is below a secondary, smaller threshold (e.g., sub-pixel), the node might be culled entirely.

            Task R2.1.3: Define configurable screen-space error thresholds (e.g., in pixels) that determine when to switch LOD levels or cull.

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Major changes to rendering logic to incorporate screen-space error calculation and decision-making.

            src/octree.h/.cpp (from R1): OctreeNode will provide its AABB. May need helper functions for AABB projection.

            OpenGL rendering pipeline (MVP matrix access).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The screen-space error of an octree node can be correctly calculated based on its AABB and the current view.

            During octree traversal for rendering, recursion into child nodes stops if the parent node's screen-space error is below a defined threshold.

            Nodes projecting to a very small screen area (e.g., less than 1-2 pixels) are culled or rendered with extreme simplification.

            A noticeable improvement in rendering performance (FPS) is observed, especially when parts of the scene are distant or occupy small screen areas, compared to R1's distance-based LOD.

            Visual quality remains acceptable, with detail reduction being more tied to perceptual impact.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R2.1.1: Load a large, deep point cloud. Zoom out significantly.

                Test Data: Point cloud with 5M+ points, forming a scene with large depth variation.

                Expected Result: Visually observe that distant parts of the point cloud are rendered with significantly less detail or are culled. FPS should remain high. Debug output should confirm fewer nodes/points are being processed for rendering compared to R1's LOD.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection, FPS counter, debugger, profiler.

            Test Case R2.1.2: Programmatically set camera parameters to make specific octree nodes have a small screen-space projection.

                Test Data: Point cloud with a known octree structure. Specific camera MVP matrix.

                Expected Result: Verify through debug logs or internal counters that these nodes are either culled or processed at a coarser LOD level due to screen-space error.

                Testing Tool: Google Test, debugger.

            Test Case R2.1.3: Compare performance and visual quality against R1's distance-based LOD.

                Test Data: Various large point clouds.

                Expected Result: Screen-space error LOD should generally provide better performance for a given visual quality, or better visual quality for similar performance, especially in scenes with complex perspective.

                Testing Tool: FPS counter, visual comparison.

User Story R2.2: Refined Point Selection for Coarse LOD Octree Nodes

    As a developer,

    I want to implement a refined strategy for selecting points to render from octree nodes that are displayed at a coarse Level of Detail (LOD),

    So that distant parts of the point cloud are represented more effectively and with less visual noise than rendering all points from a coarser octree cell.

        Description: In Sprint R1, if distance-based LOD stopped recursion early, the coarse node might render all its points (if it's an internal node also storing points, or a leaf from a shallower depth). This story aims to improve this by rendering a representative subset of points from such coarse nodes. This subset could be a random sample, or points near the node's centroid, or a pre-calculated representative set.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R2.2.1: Decide on a point selection strategy for coarse LOD nodes (e.g., random sampling, centroid-based sampling, or storing a small representative point set within each internal octree node during octree construction). For R2, random sampling of a fixed number or percentage of points from the node is a good start.

            Task R2.2.2: If necessary, modify OctreeNode structure/methods:

                If pre-calculated samples are used: Add storage for representative points in internal nodes and populate during octree construction.

                If dynamic sampling: Add a method to OctreeNode like getSampledPoints(int count) or getSampledPoints(float percentage).

            Task R2.2.3: Update the rendering logic in PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL():

                When an octree node is determined to be rendered at a coarse LOD (due to screen-space error from US R2.1 or distance from R1), instead of rendering all its points (if it's a leaf) or all points from its children (if recursion stopped at an internal node), call the new sampling method to get a subset of points.

                Render only this subset.

                The number of points in the subset could be fixed, or proportional to the node's screen-space error or distance.

        References between Files:

            src/octree.h/.cpp (from R1): Potential modifications to OctreeNode for storing/providing sampled points.

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Modifications to rendering logic to call and use the point sampling mechanism.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When an octree node is rendered at a coarse LOD, a subset of its representative points is rendered, not all points it contains or its children contain.

            The visual representation of distant parts of the point cloud appears less cluttered and more representative of the underlying shape compared to rendering all points from coarse cells.

            The point sampling mechanism is reasonably efficient and does not introduce significant overhead.

            The number of points sampled can be controlled (e.g., fixed number, percentage).

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R2.2.1: Load a dense point cloud and view it from a distance where coarse LOD is active.

                Test Data: A dense point cloud (e.g., 1M+ points in a small volume).

                Expected Result: Visually confirm that distant representations are sparser but still convey the shape. Compare visual output with R1's coarse LOD rendering (if R1 rendered all points from coarse nodes). The number of points rendered for distant nodes should be significantly less than the total points those nodes cover.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection, debugger to check number of points rendered per node.

            Test Case R2.2.2: Implement a debug mode to visualize which points are selected for coarse LOD nodes.

                Test Data: Any point cloud.

                Expected Result: Selected sample points are highlighted or rendered differently, confirming the sampling strategy is active.

                Testing Tool: Debug rendering mode in PointCloudViewerWidget.

User Story R2.3: Implement UI Controls for LOD System

    As a user,

    I want UI controls to enable/disable the LOD system and adjust its aggressiveness in the PointCloudViewerWidget,

    So that I can balance rendering performance and visual detail according to my needs and system capabilities.

        Description: This involves adding UI elements, likely in the MainWindow or a dedicated settings panel, that allow the user to toggle the LOD system on/off and control parameters like the screen-space error threshold or a general "LOD quality/aggressiveness" slider.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task R2.3.1: Add UI elements to MainWindow (or a new settings dialog accessible from it):

                A checkbox to "Enable Level of Detail (LOD)".

                A slider or spin box to control "LOD Quality" or "Screen-Space Error Threshold". This control would adjust the pixel error value used in US R2.1.

            Task R2.3.2: Add public slots in PointCloudViewerWidget to receive updates from these UI controls, e.g., setLODEnabled(bool enabled) and setScreenSpaceErrorThreshold(float threshold).

            Task R2.3.3: Connect the UI elements' signals (e.g., toggled(bool), valueChanged(int)) to these new slots in PointCloudViewerWidget.

            Task R2.3.4: Modify PointCloudViewerWidget to use these member variables (e.g., m_lodEnabled, m_screenSpaceErrorThreshold) in its rendering logic. If LOD is disabled, it should revert to rendering more points (perhaps only view-frustum culling from R1, or even all points for testing comparison).

        References between Files:

            src/mainwindow.h/.cpp: Addition of UI controls and signal/slot connections.

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h/.cpp: Addition of public slots, member variables for LOD parameters, and modification of rendering logic to use these parameters.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A UI checkbox allows enabling/disabling the LOD system.

            A UI slider/spin box allows adjusting the LOD aggressiveness (e.g., screen-space error threshold).

            Changes made in the UI controls are reflected in the rendering behavior of PointCloudViewerWidget (e.g., disabling LOD results in more points rendered; increasing aggressiveness results in fewer points).

            The UI controls are clearly labeled and intuitive to use.

            LOD settings are applied in real-time or require a clear action (e.g., "Apply" button).

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case R2.3.1: Toggle the "Enable LOD" checkbox.

                Test Data: A large point cloud.

                Expected Result: When unchecked, more points are rendered (potentially all visible points if R1's distance LOD is also disabled), and FPS may drop. When checked, LOD (screen-space error + refined selection) is active, fewer points are rendered for distant/small areas, and FPS improves.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection, FPS counter.

            Test Case R2.3.2: Adjust the "LOD Quality" slider.

                Test Data: A large point cloud.

                Expected Result: Moving the slider towards lower quality (higher screen-space error tolerance) results in fewer points being rendered and higher FPS. Moving towards higher quality (lower error tolerance) results in more points and potentially lower FPS. Visual changes in detail should be observable.

                Testing Tool: Visual inspection, FPS counter.

Data Flows (Conceptual for this Sprint):

    Loading: (As per R1) PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud(points) builds an Octree.

        Potentially, OctreeNodes might pre-calculate/store representative point samples during this phase if that strategy is chosen for US R2.2.

    Rendering (paintGL in PointCloudViewerWidget):
    a.  User-configurable LOD parameters (m_lodEnabled, m_screenSpaceErrorThreshold) are checked.
    b.  If LOD is enabled:
    i.  Camera view and projection matrices are updated. View frustum and viewport info are available.
    ii. Recursive octree traversal starts from the root.
    iii. Inside renderOctreeNode(node, ...):
    1.  Perform view-frustum culling for node.bounds (from R1). If culled, return.
    2.  Calculate node's screen-space error (US R2.1).
    3.  If screenSpaceError < primaryThreshold:
    * This node is rendered at a coarse LOD.
    * Select a representative subset of points from this node (US R2.2) (e.g., node.getSampledPoints()).
    * Add these sampled points to a list for rendering. Do not recurse further down this branch.
    4.  Else (if screenSpaceError >= primaryThreshold):
    * If node is a leaf node: Add all node.points to the list for rendering.
    * If node is an internal node: Recursively call renderOctreeNode for its children.
    5.  (Optionally, if screenSpaceError < verySmallThreshold, cull the node entirely).
    c.  If LOD is disabled: Render using a simpler strategy (e.g., R1's view-frustum culling only, or render all points).
    d.  The aggregated list of visible/selected points is uploaded to a dynamic VBO and drawn.

6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint R2 is:

    LOD selection in PointCloudViewerWidget is primarily driven by a screen-space error metric.

    Coarse LOD octree nodes are rendered using a representative subset of their points, improving visual quality for distant areas.

    Users can enable/disable the LOD system and adjust its aggressiveness via UI controls.

    The enhanced LOD system demonstrates measurable improvements in rendering performance (FPS) and/or visual quality compared to the R1 foundational LOD.

    The application remains stable and responsive when using the enhanced LOD system with large point clouds.

7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:

    Unit Tests (Google Test):

        Screen-Space Error Calculation: Test with known AABBs, camera matrices, and viewport sizes to verify correct pixel error/extent calculation.

        Refined Point Selection: For a given OctreeNode and sampling parameters, verify that the correct number/type of points are returned.

        LOD Parameter Handling: Test that PointCloudViewerWidget correctly updates its internal LOD parameters when its public slots are called.

    Integration Tests (within PointCloudViewerWidget and MainWindow context):

        Load various large and complex point clouds.

        Visual Verification:

            Confirm that LOD changes dynamically and appropriately as the camera moves (zooming, panning, rotating).

            Verify that distant/small projected nodes are simplified or culled.

            Check that the refined point selection for coarse nodes provides a good visual representation.

            Test UI controls: enable/disable LOD, adjust quality/threshold slider, and observe corresponding changes in rendering.

        Performance Measurement:

            Use an FPS counter to measure rendering performance with different LOD settings and on different datasets. Compare against R1 performance.

            Profile rendering loop to identify bottlenecks if performance is not as expected.

        Comparison: Compare visual output and performance against R1's distance-based LOD to quantify improvements.

    Code Reviews: Review screen-space error logic, point sampling algorithms, and UI integration.

Test Data Requirements for Sprint R2:

    Large point clouds (5M - 20M+ points) with varying characteristics:

        Significant depth complexity (e.g., long corridors, landscapes).

        Dense and sparse regions.

        Scenes with many small, distant features.

    Point clouds with known octree structures (if possible, for programmatic verification of culling/LOD decisions).

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint R1 Completion: A functional octree data structure (Octree, OctreeNode) exists and is integrated for basic view-frustum culling and distance-based LOD. PointCloudViewerWidget can render points from this octree.

        3D Math Utilities: Access to robust 3D math functions for matrix operations, vector math, and AABB projection is available.

        OpenGL Context: A working OpenGL context is available in PointCloudViewerWidget for rendering and obtaining viewport/matrix information.

        Performance Focus: The primary goal is improved performance and visual consistency; perfect, seamless LOD transitions (e.g., geomorphing) are out of scope for R2 but can be considered for future sprints.

    Dependencies:

        Completed Octree and OctreeNode classes from Sprint R1.

        Functional PointCloudViewerWidget from Sprint R1 capable of octree-based rendering.

        Qt 6 framework (Core, GUI, OpenGL, Widgets).

        C++ compiler with C++17 support.

        Google Test framework for unit testing.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    NFR-R2.1 (Performance - Rendering FPS): The enhanced LOD system must maintain or improve interactive frame rates (>30 FPS, ideally >60 FPS) compared to R1 when navigating large point clouds, especially in views with high depth complexity.

    NFR-R2.2 (Performance - LOD Overhead): The overhead of screen-space error calculation and refined point selection should be minimal and outweighed by the rendering performance gains from culling/simplification.

    NFR-R2.3 (Visual Quality - LOD): Detail reduction due to LOD should be perceptually acceptable. Screen-space error should lead to more consistent visual detail across the view. Refined point selection should make coarse LOD representations look less noisy.

    NFR-R2.4 (Responsiveness - UI Controls): UI controls for LOD should respond promptly, and changes to LOD settings should be reflected in the viewer in near real-time.

    NFR-R2.5 (Stability): The enhanced LOD system must not introduce instability, crashes, or significant visual artifacts.

10. Conclusion

Sprint R2 aims to elevate the advanced rendering capabilities by making the LOD system smarter and more user-controllable. The introduction of screen-space error metrics and refined point selection for coarse nodes will address key limitations of basic LOD approaches, leading to a more efficient and visually appealing experience when handling large-scale point cloud data. The addition of UI controls empowers users to tailor the visualization to their specific needs and hardware. Successful completion of this sprint will mark a significant step towards production-quality rendering performance.
