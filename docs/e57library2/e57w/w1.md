# Sprint W1 Backlog: E57 Writing - Basic E57 Structure Writing (Header, Prototype Definition)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 31, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 File Writing & Advanced Rendering Capabilities (prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering)
**Sprint Goal:** To implement the foundational E57 file creation logic using `libE57Format`, including initializing an E57 file in write mode, writing the `E57Root` and initial `Data3D` header elements for a single scan, defining a `CompressedVectorNode` with a `prototype` for standard Cartesian XYZ data, and ensuring the generation of a minimal, structurally valid E57 file (even if it contains zero points initially).

## 1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint W1 of Phase 1: "E57 Writing Capabilities," as outlined in the PRD `prd_e57_writing_advanced_rendering`. This sprint focuses on establishing the core framework for writing E57 files. Key tasks include initializing an E57 file using `libE57Format`'s Foundation API, defining the necessary XML hierarchy for a single scan (including the `/data3D` vector and a `Data3D` structure), and specifying the `prototype` for point data that will, at a minimum, include Cartesian X, Y, and Z coordinates. The primary output will be the ability to generate a structurally correct, albeit empty (in terms of point data), E57 file that can be recognized by standard E57 viewers.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story W1.1: Initialize E57 File for Writing

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** to use `libE57Format` to create and initialize a new E57 file in write mode, setting up the basic file header,
* **So that** the application has a valid E57 container ready for subsequent metadata and data population.
    * **Description**: This involves using the `e57::ImageFile` constructor with "w" mode. The library handles the creation of the low-level E57 page structure and the initial file signature and version information in the physical header. The `E57Root` node is also implicitly created.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W1.1.1**: Create or extend an E57 writer class (e.g., `E57WriterLib`) with a method to initialize a new E57 file.
            * *Input*: Output file path string.
            * *Output*: An opened `e57::ImageFile` instance in write mode.
            * *Reference Code (Initializing ImageFile for writing)*:
                ```cpp
                // In E57WriterLib::createE57File(const std::string& filePath)
                // e57::ImageFile* imf = nullptr;
                // try {
                //     imf = new e57::ImageFile(filePath, "w"); // "w" for write mode
                //     if (!imf->isOpen()) { /* handle error */ }
                //     m_imageFile = std::unique_ptr<e57::ImageFile>(imf); // Store for later use
                //     // Setup basic E57Root elements like formatName, guid
                //     e57::StructureNode rootNode = m_imageFile->root();
                //     rootNode.set("formatName", e57::StringNode(m_imageFile.get(), "ASTM E57 3D Imaging Data File"));
                //     rootNode.set("guid", e57::StringNode(m_imageFile.get(), "{YOUR-UNIQUE-GUID-HERE}")); // Generate a new GUID
                // } catch (e57::E57Exception& ex) { /* handle error, delete imf if created */ }
                ```
        * **Task W1.1.2**: Implement robust error handling for file creation failures (e.g., invalid path, permissions issues) by catching `e57::E57Exception`.
        * **Task W1.1.3**: Ensure the `e57::ImageFile` object is properly managed (e.g., using `std::unique_ptr`) and closed upon completion or error.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp` (new or modified) will implement this.
        * `src/e57writer_lib.h` (new or modified) will declare the class and methods.
        * Includes `<e57/E57Foundation.h>`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The `E57WriterLib` can create a new, empty E57 file at a specified path.
        2.  The created file has the correct E57 signature ("ASTM-E57") and version in its physical header.
        3.  The `e57::ImageFile` object is successfully initialized in write mode.
        4.  Basic `E57Root` elements like `formatName` and a generated `guid` are written.
        5.  File creation errors are caught and reported appropriately.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W1.1.1**: Attempt to create an E57 file in a writable directory.
            * **Test Data**: Valid output file path.
            * **Expected Result**: A small E57 file is created. `E57WriterLib::getLastError()` is empty. The file can be minimally inspected by a hex editor to verify the "ASTM-E57" signature and version.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, Hex Editor, `libE57Format` (for reading back).
        * **Test Case W1.1.2**: Attempt to create an E57 file in a non-writable directory.
            * **Test Data**: Invalid output file path (e.g., protected directory).
            * **Expected Result**: File creation fails. `E57WriterLib::getLastError()` contains an error message related to file I/O or permissions.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.

### User Story W1.2: Define Core E57 XML Structure for a Single Scan

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to define the essential XML structure within the E57 file for a single scan, including the `/data3D` `VectorNode` and a child `Data3D` `StructureNode` with basic header elements,
* **So that** the E57 file is prepared to store scan-specific metadata and point data.
    * **Description**: This involves creating the `/data3D` `VectorNode` if it doesn't exist, and then adding a new `Data3D` `StructureNode` to it. This `Data3D` node will be populated with essential header information like a unique `guid` for the scan and a default `name`.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W1.2.1**: In `E57WriterLib`, after initializing `ImageFile`, get the `E57Root` node.
        * **Task W1.2.2**: Create a `VectorNode` at the path `/data3D` in the `E57Root`. Set `allowHeterogeneousChildren` to `false` as `Data3D` entries should be uniform `StructureNode`s.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`.
            * *Output*: `/data3D` `VectorNode` created in the E57 tree.
            * *Reference Code (Creating /data3D VectorNode)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode rootNode = m_imageFile->root();
                // e57::VectorNode data3DNode(m_imageFile.get(), false); // false for allowHeterogeneousChildren
                // rootNode.set("/data3D", data3DNode);
                ```
        * **Task W1.2.3**: Create a new `StructureNode` (representing a single `Data3D` scan header) and append it as a child to the `/data3D` `VectorNode`.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `/data3D` `VectorNode`.
            * *Output*: New `Data3D` `StructureNode` added to `/data3D`.
            * *Reference Code (Adding a Data3D scan entry)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode scanHeaderNode(m_imageFile.get());
                // data3DNode.append(scanHeaderNode);
                ```
        * **Task W1.2.4**: Populate the newly created `Data3D` `StructureNode` with mandatory/default header elements:
            * `guid` (StringNode): Generate a new unique GUID.
            * `name` (StringNode): Default name like "Scan_001".
            * (Other fields like `description`, `sensorModel`, `acquisitionStart`, `pose`, `cartesianBounds`, `intensityLimits`, `colorLimits` will be deferred to later sprints but their paths should be noted).
            * *Reference Code (Populating Data3D header)*:
                ```cpp
                // scanHeaderNode.set("guid", e57::StringNode(m_imageFile.get(), "{NEW-SCAN-GUID-HERE}"));
                // scanHeaderNode.set("name", e57::StringNode(m_imageFile.get(), "Default Scan 001"));
                ```
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Implements this logic.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The generated E57 file contains a `/data3D` `VectorNode` at the root level.
        2.  The `/data3D` node contains at least one child `StructureNode` (representing a scan).
        3.  The scan's `StructureNode` contains `StringNode` children for `guid` and `name` with valid values.
        4.  The E57 file remains valid and can be opened by `libE57Format` in read mode.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W1.2.1**: Generate an E57 file and verify its XML structure.
            * **Test Data**: N/A (generates a new file).
            * **Expected Result**: The generated E57 file, when its XML portion is dumped (e.g., using `e57xmldump` or by reading with `libE57Format` and inspecting the node tree), shows the `/data3D` vector with one child `StructureNode` containing `guid` and `name`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (for reading/verification), `e57xmldump` utility.

### User Story W1.3: Define Point Prototype for XYZ Data

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57WriterLib` to define a `points` `CompressedVectorNode` within the `Data3D` scan structure, and set up its `prototype` `StructureNode` to include fields for `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, and `cartesianZ` (e.g., as double-precision `FloatNode`s),
* **So that** the E57 file is structured to store 3D point coordinate data according to the standard.
    * **Description**: This story focuses on defining the schema for the point data itself. Within the `Data3D` structure created in User Story W1.2, a `CompressedVectorNode` named `points` will be added. This node requires a `prototype` which is a `StructureNode` defining each field of a point record. For this sprint, the prototype will only include `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, and `cartesianZ`, specified as `FloatNode`s, typically with double precision.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task W1.3.1**: Within the `Data3D` `StructureNode` (from Task W1.2.3), create a `CompressedVectorNode` named `points`.
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `Data3D` `StructureNode scanHeaderNode`.
            * *Output*: `points` `CompressedVectorNode` added to `scanHeaderNode`.
            * *Reference Code (Creating CompressedVectorNode)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode prototypeStructure(m_imageFile.get()); // Prototype is a StructureNode
                // // ... (Define prototype fields in next task) ...
                //
                // e57::CompressedVectorNode pointsNode(m_imageFile.get(), prototypeStructure);
                // scanHeaderNode.set("points", pointsNode);
                //
                // // Also set the required 'codecs' VectorNode for the CompressedVectorNode
                // // Even if empty for uncompressed data, it's often expected.
                // e57::VectorNode codecsNode(m_imageFile.get(), true); // allowHeterogeneousChildren = true for codecs
                // pointsNode.set("codecs", codecsNode);
                ```
        * **Task W1.3.2**: Create a `StructureNode` to serve as the `prototype` for the `points` `CompressedVectorNode`.
        * **Task W1.3.3**: Add three `FloatNode` children to this `prototype` `StructureNode`, named `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, and `cartesianZ`. Specify their precision (e.g., `e57::PrecisionDouble`).
            * *Input*: `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `prototype` `StructureNode`.
            * *Output*: `prototype` populated with XYZ `FloatNode`s.
            * *Reference Code (Defining XYZ in prototype)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode prototypeStructure(m_imageFile.get());
                // prototypeStructure.set("cartesianX", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0.0, e57::PrecisionDouble, -DBL_MAX, DBL_MAX)); // Value, Precision, Min, Max
                // prototypeStructure.set("cartesianY", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0.0, e57::PrecisionDouble, -DBL_MAX, DBL_MAX));
                // prototypeStructure.set("cartesianZ", e57::FloatNode(m_imageFile.get(), 0.0, e57::PrecisionDouble, -DBL_MAX, DBL_MAX));
                // // Then, assign this prototypeStructure to the CompressedVectorNode as shown in Task W1.3.1
                ```
        * **Task W1.3.4**: Set the `recordCount` attribute of the `CompressedVectorNode` to 0 for this sprint (as no actual points are being written yet).
            * *Reference Code*: The `recordCount` is an attribute of the `CompressedVectorNode` itself, or a child of a `CompressedVectorNode`'s `codecs` section (if using the older style). `libE57Format` usually manages this implicitly via the writer, but for schema definition, ensuring it's conceptually 0 is key. The actual `childCount()` of the `CompressedVectorNode` will be 0 until points are written.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57writer_lib.cpp`: Implements this logic.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The `Data3D` `StructureNode` in the generated E57 file contains a child `CompressedVectorNode` named `points`.
        2.  The `points` `CompressedVectorNode` has a valid `prototype` `StructureNode`.
        3.  The `prototype` contains `FloatNode` children named `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, and `cartesianZ`.
        4.  These coordinate `FloatNode`s are specified with double precision.
        5.  The `points` `CompressedVectorNode` initially indicates zero point records.
        6.  The E57 file remains valid.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case W1.3.1**: Generate an E57 file and inspect its XML for the `points` node and its prototype.
            * **Test Data**: N/A.
            * **Expected Result**: XML dump shows `/data3D/0/points` as a `CompressedVectorNode` with a `prototype` containing `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ` `FloatNode`s with `precision="double"`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, `libE57Format` (read/inspect), `e57xmldump`.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint W1 is:
1.  The application can programmatically create a new E57 file.
2.  The created E57 file contains the standard `E57Root` structure with a `/data3D` `VectorNode`.
3.  The `/data3D` node contains one `Data3D` `StructureNode` representing a single scan, populated with a unique GUID and a default name.
4.  The `Data3D` node contains a `points` `CompressedVectorNode` with a `prototype` defined for `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ` as double-precision `FloatNode`s.
5.  The `points` `CompressedVectorNode` is initialized to contain zero points.
6.  The generated E57 file is structurally valid and can be opened without errors by `libE57Format` in read mode and by at least one common third-party E57 viewer (e.g., CloudCompare, verifying structure only).
7.  Basic error handling for file creation and node manipulation is implemented.

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Unit Tests (Google Test)**: Focus on the `E57WriterLib` class.
    * Test successful creation of an empty E57 file.
    * Test writing of `E57Root` metadata (`guid`, `formatName`).
    * Test creation and population of the `/data3D` `VectorNode`.
    * Test creation and population of a `Data3D` `StructureNode` (scan header with `guid`, `name`).
    * Test creation of the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` and its `prototype` with XYZ `FloatNode`s (double precision).
    * Verify that the `recordCount` (or `childCount`) of the `points` node is 0.
    * Test error handling for invalid file paths or write permission issues.
* **File Validation**:
    * Use `libE57Format` (in read mode within a test utility or unit test) to open and inspect the structure of the generated E57 files, verifying the presence and types of all defined nodes.
    * Use an external tool like `e57xmldump` (if available) or CloudCompare to open the generated E57 file and visually inspect its XML structure and confirm it reports zero points.

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint W1:**
* N/A for input E57 files, as this sprint focuses on *creating* new E57 files.
* Output validation will require tools capable of reading E57 structure.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  `libE57Format` (e.g., `asmaloney/libE57Format` fork) is successfully integrated into the project's build system (as per Sprint 1 of the E57 Reading PRD). The development environment can compile and link against it.
    2.  Developers have a working understanding of the `libE57Format` Foundation API for creating and manipulating E57 nodes.
    3.  The application's internal representation of point data (e.g., `std::vector<float>` or a custom struct) is defined, although actual point data writing is for Sprint W2. For this sprint, we only define the E57 schema for it.
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  C++ Compiler (supporting C++17 or as required by `libE57Format`).
    2.  CMake (version 3.15 or higher).
    3.  `vcpkg` (or chosen package manager) for `libE57Format` and its dependencies (Xerces-C).
    4.  `libE57Format` library.
    5.  Google Test framework.
    6.  (Optional but recommended) External E57 viewing/validation tools like CloudCompare or `e57xmldump`.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR-W1.1 (E57 Compliance)**: Generated E57 file structures must strictly adhere to the ASTM E2807 standard to ensure basic readability by other compliant software.
* **NFR-W1.2 (Resource Management)**: The `E57WriterLib` must correctly manage `libE57Format` resources, ensuring `e57::ImageFile` is properly closed and memory is handled without leaks, especially in error scenarios.
* **NFR-W1.3 (Code Maintainability)**: The code for E57 structure writing should be clear, well-commented, and organized to facilitate understanding and future extensions (e.g., adding more attributes to the prototype in Sprint W3).

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint W1 lays the critical groundwork for the E57 writing capability. By focusing on the correct initialization of E57 files and the definition of the fundamental XML structure for scan data and point prototypes using `libE57Format`, this sprint will establish a solid foundation. The ability to generate a minimal, structurally valid E57 file, even without point data, is a key milestone that will enable incremental development and testing of point data writing in subsequent sprints.
