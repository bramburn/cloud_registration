# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 7, Sub-Sprint 7.2 - Bundle Adjustment Integration & Execution

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 7.2: Bundle
Adjustment Integration & Execution. This sub-sprint focuses on
integrating the BundleAdjustment algorithm into the application\'s
workflow. It allows users to perform global optimization on their
PoseGraph, aiming to distribute and minimize accumulated errors across
all registered scans, thereby improving overall project accuracy.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, I want to optimize the overall accuracy
  of my multi-scan project using Bundle Adjustment.

  - **Description**: For projects with multiple pairwise registrations,
    errors can accumulate. Bundle Adjustment (BA) is a global
    optimization technique that refines all scan poses simultaneously to
    minimize reprojection errors. Users need a way to initiate this
    process.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Add \"Run Bundle Adjustment\" Button**: In
        src/ui/src/PoseGraphViewerWidget.cpp (or a control panel
        associated with the Pose Graph view), add a QPushButton labeled
        \"Run Bundle Adjustment\".

    2.  **Button Enablement Logic**: Implement logic to enable this
        button only when a PoseGraph is loaded in MainPresenter and
        contains at least 3 nodes and 2 edges (minimal configuration for
        a meaningful BA).

    3.  **Connect Button to MainPresenter**: Connect the clicked signal
        of this button to a new public slot in MainPresenter:
        handleRunBundleAdjustment().

    4.  **Implement MainPresenter::handleRunBundleAdjustment()**:

        - In src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp, implement this slot.

        - **Pre-check**: Verify m_currentPoseGraph is valid and meets
          minimum criteria. If not, display an error message.

        - **Launch Progress Dialog**: Instantiate and show a
          BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog (new component, similar to
          ICPProgressWidget).

        - **Trigger BA**: Call
          Optimization::BundleAdjustment::optimize(m_currentPoseGraph)
          (ensure this runs asynchronously if it\'s long).

        - Pass the initial PoseGraph to the BundleAdjustment algorithm.

        - Connect Optimization::BundleAdjustment::optimizationProgress
          and optimizationCompleted signals to appropriate slots in
          MainPresenter for relaying to the progress dialog.

        - Connect BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog::cancelRequested to
          Optimization::BundleAdjustment::cancel().

  - **References between Files**:

    - PoseGraphViewerWidget.h / PoseGraphViewerWidget.cpp: Adds \"Run
      Bundle Adjustment\" button, manages its enabled state.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Adds
      handleRunBundleAdjustment() slot. Calls
      Optimization::BundleAdjustment::optimize(), launches
      BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog (new UI component).

    - Optimization::BundleAdjustment.h / BundleAdjustment.cpp:
      optimize() method, optimizationProgress, optimizationCompleted
      signals.

    - Registration::PoseGraph.h: The input graph for BA.

    - BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.h /
      BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.cpp: New UI component for BA
      progress.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - A \"Run Bundle Adjustment\" button is visible in the Pose Graph
      view.

    - The button is enabled only when a valid PoseGraph with at least 3
      nodes and 2 edges is present.

    - Clicking the button launches a BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog and
      initiates the BundleAdjustment algorithm.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: \"Run Bundle Adjustment\" button enablement.

      - **Test Data**: Mock MainPresenter to provide PoseGraphs of
        varying sizes (0 nodes, 1 node, 2 nodes/1 edge, 3 nodes/2
        edges).

      - **Expected Result**: Button disabled for insufficient graph,
        enabled for valid graph.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_posegraphviewerwidget.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: Button click triggers MainPresenter and BA
      execution.

      - **Test Data**: Mock MainPresenter. Mock
        BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog. Mock
        Optimization::BundleAdjustment.

      - **Expected Result**: Clicking the button calls
        MainPresenter::handleRunBundleAdjustment(), which launches the
        progress dialog and calls
        Optimization::BundleAdjustment::optimize().

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_posegraphviewerwidget.cpp,
        test_mainpresenter.cpp).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to see the progress of the Bundle
  Adjustment algorithm.

  - **Description**: Bundle Adjustment can be computationally intensive.
    Providing real-time feedback on its iterations, error reduction, and
    elapsed time is essential for user confidence and responsiveness.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Create BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog**: Create new files
        src/ui/include/ui/BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.h and
        src/ui/src/BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.cpp. This will be a
        modal QDialog.

    2.  **Design BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog UI**:

        - Include QProgressBar for overall progress.

        - QLabels for: \"Iteration: X / Y\", \"Current Error: Z\",
          \"Initial Error: A\", \"Elapsed Time: B\".

        - A \"Cancel\" button.

    3.  **Implement Optimization::BundleAdjustment::optimize()
        Progress**: In src/optimization/src/BundleAdjustment.cpp, ensure
        the optimize() method emits optimizationProgress(int iteration,
        double currentError, double lambda) in each iteration.

    4.  **Connect Progress Signals**:

        - In MainPresenter::handleRunBundleAdjustment(): Connect
          Optimization::BundleAdjustment::optimizationProgress to
          BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog::updateProgress().

    5.  **Implement BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog::updateProgress()**:
        This slot needs to update the UI elements based on the received
        progress data.

  - **References between Files**:

    - BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.h /
      BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.cpp: New UI component, displays BA
      progress.

    - Optimization::BundleAdjustment.h / BundleAdjustment.cpp:
      optimize() method emits optimizationProgress signal.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Connects signals between
      BundleAdjustment and BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - The BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog appears when BA starts.

    - The dialog\'s progress bar, iteration count, and current error
      update in real-time.

    - An elapsed time counter is displayed and updates.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog updates UI.

      - **Test Data**: Call updateProgress() with a sequence of BA
        progress values.

      - **Expected Result**: UI elements update correctly.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test
        (test_bundleadjustmentprogressdialog.cpp - new file).

    - **Test Case 2**: BundleAdjustment emits progress signals.

      - **Test Data**: Provide a synthetic PoseGraph that requires
        multiple iterations. Call optimize().

      - **Expected Result**: optimizationProgress signals are emitted
        with valid iteration, error, and lambda values.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_bundleadjustment.cpp - new
        file).

- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want to be able to cancel Bundle
  Adjustment.

  - **Description**: Bundle Adjustment can be very long-running. Users
    need the ability to gracefully stop the process if it\'s taking too
    long, not converging, or if they wish to abort for other reasons.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **\"Cancel\" Button in BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog**: Ensure
        the dialog has a \"Cancel\" button.

    2.  **Connect cancelRequested Signal**: Connect
        BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog::cancelRequested() signal to
        MainPresenter::cancelBundleAdjustment().

    3.  **Implement MainPresenter::cancelBundleAdjustment()**: This slot
        will call Optimization::BundleAdjustment::cancel().

    4.  **Implement Optimization::BundleAdjustment::cancel()**: In
        src/optimization/src/BundleAdjustment.cpp, implement this method
        to set an internal atomic flag (m_isCancelled). The optimize()
        loop must check this flag periodically and break if set.

    5.  **Handle Cancellation Completion**: When BundleAdjustment
        detects cancellation, it should emit
        optimizationCompleted(false, \...) to indicate non-successful
        termination. MainPresenter will then handle UI state.

  - **References between Files**:

    - BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.h /
      BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.cpp: Has \"Cancel\" button, emits
      cancelRequested().

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Adds cancelBundleAdjustment()
      slot, connects to dialog. Calls
      Optimization::BundleAdjustment::cancel().

    - Optimization::BundleAdjustment.h / BundleAdjustment.cpp: Adds void
      cancel(); method (sets m_isCancelled flag), optimize() loop checks
      flag, emits optimizationCompleted(false, \...) on cancellation.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - A \"Cancel\" button is visible and active in
      BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog.

    - Clicking the \"Cancel\" button stops the Bundle Adjustment
      computation.

    - The BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog indicates \"Cancelled\" status.

    - No changes are permanently applied to scan poses if cancelled.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: BundleAdjustmentProgressDialog emits cancel.

      - **Test Data**: N/A.

      - **Expected Result**: Clicking \"Cancel\" button emits
        cancelRequested().

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test
        (test_bundleadjustmentprogressdialog.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: MainPresenter relays cancel.

      - **Test Data**: Mock Optimization::BundleAdjustment.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter::cancelBundleAdjustment()
        calls Optimization::BundleAdjustment::cancel().

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 3**: BundleAdjustment cancels execution.

      - **Test Data**: Provide a large PoseGraph to BundleAdjustment.

      - **Expected Result**: Call optimize(), then cancel(). The
        optimize() method returns early, and
        optimizationCompleted(false, \...) is emitted.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_bundleadjustment.cpp).

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 7.1 Completion**: PoseGraphBuilder and
  PoseGraphViewerWidget are fully functional, providing a valid
  PoseGraph for BA.

- **Optimization::BundleAdjustment (Backend)**: The core BA algorithm is
  implemented and capable of performing optimization on a PoseGraph
  (even if computationally intensive initially).

- **Asynchronous Execution**: BundleAdjustment should ideally run in a
  separate thread to keep the UI responsive.

- **RegistrationProject::setScanTransform()**: This method (from S3.1)
  is robust and used to apply the new, optimized global poses to the
  scans.

- **Qt Graphics**: QGraphicsView for PoseGraphViewerWidget is
  integrated.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: BA is computationally intensive. The application
  should remain responsive during BA via asynchronous execution and
  progress feedback. The BA algorithm itself should strive for
  reasonable performance for typical graph sizes.

- **Accuracy**: The BundleAdjustment algorithm should converge to an
  accurate, globally optimal solution.

- **Usability**: The progress dialog provides clear and understandable
  feedback on BA status. The cancellation mechanism is reliable.

- **Robustness**: The BA algorithm should handle numerical instabilities
  or non-converging scenarios gracefully, reporting errors without
  crashing.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 7.2 delivers the critical global optimization capability of
Bundle Adjustment. By integrating this advanced algorithm with clear
progress feedback and control, it significantly enhances the
application\'s ability to achieve high accuracy for large, multi-scan
projects, marking a major milestone in Production Hardening.
