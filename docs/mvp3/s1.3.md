# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 1, Sub-Sprint 1.3 - Finalization, Export & End-to-End Test

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 1.3, which
represents the culmination of Phase 1 (MVP Delivery). This sub-sprint
focuses on completing the manual alignment workflow by enabling users to
finalize (accept/cancel) their registrations, export the results, and
ensuring the entire Minimum Viable Product (MVP) pipeline is thoroughly
tested with an end-to-end integration test.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, I want to confirm or discard the computed
  alignment.

  - **Description**: After previewing a manual alignment, the user needs
    explicit options to either commit the transformation permanently or
    discard it to revert to the previous state. This ensures control
    over their data.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Modify AlignmentControlPanel**: Add \"Accept\" and \"Cancel\"
        QPushButton instances to src/ui/src/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp.

    2.  **Connect UI Buttons**: Connect the clicked signals of these
        buttons to new slots in MainPresenter: handleAcceptAlignment()
        and handleCancelAlignment().

    3.  **Implement MainPresenter::handleAcceptAlignment()**:

        - Retrieve the final TransformationMatrix from
          AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().

        - Call RegistrationProject::setScanTransform() to apply this
          transformation to the target scan in the project\'s internal
          data model.

        - Create a RegistrationProject::RegistrationResult object
          (including source/target scan IDs, transformation, RMS error,
          \'Manual\' algorithm, timestamp).

        - Call RegistrationProject::addRegistrationResult() to store
          this record.

        - Call AlignmentEngine::clearCorrespondences() to reset the
          current alignment session.

        - Call PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform() to remove
          the preview.

        - Transition the RegistrationWorkflowWidget to
          RegistrationStep::QualityReview.

        - Update status bar message with success confirmation.

    4.  **Implement MainPresenter::handleCancelAlignment()**:

        - Call AlignmentEngine::clearCorrespondences().

        - Call PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform() to remove
          the preview.

        - Transition the RegistrationWorkflowWidget back to
          RegistrationStep::ManualAlignment (or SelectScans if no more
          scans are loaded).

        - Update status bar message with cancellation confirmation.

    5.  **Manage Button State**: Implement logic in
        AlignmentControlPanel to enable the \"Accept\" button only when
        AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().isValid() is true. The
        \"Cancel\" button should be enabled once manual alignment mode
        is active.

  - **References between Files**:

    - AlignmentControlPanel.h/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp: Adds/modifies
      QPushButtons, manages their enabled state.

    - MainPresenter.h/MainPresenter.cpp: Adds handleAcceptAlignment(),
      handleCancelAlignment() slots. Calls
      AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult(),
      AlignmentEngine::clearCorrespondences(),
      RegistrationProject::setScanTransform(),
      RegistrationProject::addRegistrationResult(),
      PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform(),
      RegistrationWorkflowWidget for state transitions.

    - AlignmentEngine.h/AlignmentEngine.cpp: getCurrentResult(),
      clearCorrespondences().

    - RegistrationProject.h/RegistrationProject.cpp: setScanTransform(),
      addRegistrationResult(). The RegistrationResult struct is defined
      here.

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.h/PointCloudViewerWidget.cpp:
      clearDynamicTransform().

    - RegistrationWorkflowWidget.h/RegistrationWorkflowWidget.cpp:
      Handles state transitions (RegistrationStep::QualityReview,
      RegistrationStep::ManualAlignment).

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - \"Accept\" and \"Cancel\" buttons are present in the
      AlignmentControlPanel.

    - The \"Accept\" button is enabled only when a valid alignment has
      been computed and previewed.

    - Clicking \"Accept\" results in the target scan\'s transformation
      being updated in RegistrationProject.

    - A RegistrationResult entry is created and stored in
      RegistrationProject for the accepted alignment.

    - The dynamic alignment preview is cleared from the 3D viewer, and
      the permanent transformation is rendered.

    - The UI transitions to the QualityReview step upon acceptance.

    - Clicking \"Cancel\" clears the dynamic preview and returns the
      user to the ManualAlignment step.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Accept Alignment - Valid Alignment.

      - **Test Data**: Mocked AlignmentEngine returning a valid
        transformation, RegistrationProject, PointCloudViewerWidget.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter calls setScanTransform() with
        correct matrix, addRegistrationResult() with a valid
        RegistrationResult, clearDynamicTransform(), and triggers
        RegistrationWorkflowWidget transition to QualityReview.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: Cancel Alignment.

      - **Test Data**: Mocked AlignmentEngine, PointCloudViewerWidget.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter calls clearCorrespondences()
        and clearDynamicTransform(), and triggers
        RegistrationWorkflowWidget transition back to ManualAlignment.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 3**: RegistrationProject stores results.

      - **Test Data**: Create a RegistrationProject instance. Call
        setScanTransform() and addRegistrationResult().

      - **Expected Result**: RegistrationProject\'s internal data
        reflects the new scan transform and the added
        RegistrationResult.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_registrationproject.cpp)

    - **Test Case 4**: End-to-End Finalization.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded scans, a manual
        alignment in progress.

      - **Expected Result**: User performs manual alignment, clicks
        \"Accept\". Observe the dynamic preview disappear, the scan
        render in its new, transformed position permanently, and the UI
        transitions to the \"Quality Review\" step.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation or UI
        automation script).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to export the registered point
  cloud.

  - **Description**: Once scans are aligned, the user needs to save the
    combined or transformed point cloud data in an industry-standard
    format for external use.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Enable Export Action**: Ensure the m_exportPointCloudAction in
        mainwindow.h is enabled when a project is open and contains at
        least one registered scan (i.e., RegistrationProject has a valid
        RegistrationResult).

    2.  **Connect Menu Action**: Connect m_exportPointCloudAction\'s
        triggered signal to MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud().

    3.  **Implement MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud()**:

        - Check if the PointCloudViewerWidget has loaded data
          (m_viewer-\>hasPointCloudData()). If not, show an error.

        - Call m_viewer-\>getCurrentPointCloudData() to get the entire
          point cloud data *including the applied transformations* as
          std::vector\<Point\>.

        - Instantiate and show the ExportDialog (defined in
          src/ui/include/ui/ExportDialog.h) modally.

        - Pass the retrieved std::vector\<Point\> to
          ExportDialog::setPointCloudData().

        - Connect ExportDialog::exportRequested signal to
          PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync().

        - Display progress via IMainView::showProgressDialog() and
          IMainView::updateProgress().

        - Display success/failure messages via
          IMainView::displayInfoMessage() or
          IMainView::displayErrorMessage() after
          PointCloudExporter::exportCompleted is emitted.

    4.  **IPointCloudViewer::getCurrentPointCloudData()**: This method
        in src/rendering/include/rendering/pointcloudviewerwidget.h must
        return the point cloud data with the current *permanent*
        transformations applied. It should also be able to include
        attributes (color, intensity) if available.

    5.  **PointCloudExporter Integration**: Confirm
        PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync()
        (src/export/PointCloudExporter.cpp) correctly performs the
        export operation asynchronously, emitting progressUpdated and
        exportCompleted signals.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainWindow.h/MainWindow.cpp: m_exportPointCloudAction
      (enabled/disabled logic).

    - MainPresenter.h/MainPresenter.cpp: Adds handleExportPointCloud()
      slot. Calls IPointCloudViewer::getCurrentPointCloudData(),
      launches ExportDialog, connects to PointCloudExporter.

    - IPointCloudViewer.h/IPointCloudViewer.cpp (PointCloudViewerWidget
      implements this): getCurrentPointCloudData() (returns
      std::vector\<Point\>).

    - ExportDialog.h/ExportDialog.cpp: setPointCloudData(),
      getExportOptions(), exportRequested signal.

    - PointCloudExporter.h/PointCloudExporter.cpp:
      exportPointCloudAsync(), progressUpdated, exportCompleted signals.

    - export/IFormatWriter.h: Defines the Point struct used for export.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - The \"Export Point Cloud\" menu item is enabled when a project is
      open and contains registered scans.

    - Clicking \"Export Point Cloud\" launches the ExportDialog.

    - The ExportDialog correctly displays the available point cloud data
      and allows format/option selection.

    - The PointCloudExporter is successfully invoked to perform the
      export.

    - A progress indicator is displayed during the export process.

    - Upon completion, a success or failure message is displayed to the
      user.

    - The exported file contains the point cloud data with the applied
      transformations.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Export Action Enablement.

      - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject with/without
        RegistrationResults, mock IPointCloudViewer with/without data.

      - **Expected Result**: m_exportPointCloudAction is enabled when a
        registered project is loaded and data is in the viewer;
        otherwise, it is disabled.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: Export Workflow Initiation.

      - **Test Data**: Mock IPointCloudViewer returning sample point
        data. Mock ExportDialog to emit exportRequested when exec() is
        called. Mock PointCloudExporter to simulate successful export.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud()
        calls getCurrentPointCloudData(), launches ExportDialog, and
        connects to PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync().

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 3**: IPointCloudViewer::getCurrentPointCloudData()
      correctness.

      - **Test Data**: A loaded point cloud with a known transformation
        applied (e.g., via setDynamicTransform() and then \'accepted\').

      - **Expected Result**: getCurrentPointCloudData() returns points
        transformed by the applied transformation.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp)

    - **Test Case 4**: End-to-End Export.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded and manually aligned
        scans.

      - **Expected Result**: User performs manual alignment, accepts it,
        then clicks \"Export Point Cloud\". Selects a format (e.g., LAS)
        and a save path. Observes progress bar, and a successful file is
        created at the specified path (verified by external tool).

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation and
        external file verification).

- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want to see registered scans grouped in
  the project tree.

  - **Description**: To better manage multi-scan projects, registered
    scans should be visually associated within the project tree,
    reflecting their aligned status.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Modify ProjectTreeModel::refreshFromDatabase()**: In
        src/ui/src/projecttreemodel.cpp, enhance this method to:

        - Retrieve all ScanInfos and ClusterInfos from SQLiteManager.

        - Retrieve all RegistrationProject::RegistrationResults from
          RegistrationProject::getRegistrationResults().

        - Based on RegistrationResult entries, create parent \"Scan
          Group\" nodes (e.g., Aligned Pair: ScanA - ScanB) and place
          the individual registered scans as children under these nodes.

        - Alternatively, modify existing scan nodes to indicate
          registration status (e.g., add an icon or a text suffix like
          \" (Aligned)\").

    2.  **Add ProjectTreeModel to RegistrationProject linkage**: Ensure
        RegistrationProject can notify ProjectTreeModel when a new
        RegistrationResult is added.
        RegistrationProject::addRegistrationResult() should emit a
        signal (e.g., registrationResultAdded(sourceScanId,
        targetScanId)) that MainPresenter listens to and then calls
        SidebarWidget::refreshFromDatabase() (or a more specific
        ProjectTreeModel::updateScanGrouping() method).

    3.  **Update SidebarWidget**: Ensure SidebarWidget
        (src/ui/src/sidebarwidget.cpp) correctly renders the
        hierarchical changes made by ProjectTreeModel.

  - **References between Files**:

    - ProjectTreeModel.h/ProjectTreeModel.cpp: refreshFromDatabase()
      (modified to handle grouping), potentially new internal node
      structures (TreeItem or similar). data() method will return
      grouping information/icons.

    - RegistrationProject.h/RegistrationProject.cpp:
      getRegistrationResults() (provides data), registrationResultAdded
      signal (new).

    - MainPresenter.h/MainPresenter.cpp: Listens to
      RegistrationProject::registrationResultAdded, calls
      SidebarWidget::refreshFromDatabase().

    - SidebarWidget.h/SidebarWidget.cpp: Relies on ProjectTreeModel to
      display the hierarchy.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - When a new registration is accepted, the project tree view in the
      SidebarWidget updates automatically.

    - Registered scans are displayed as a logical group or with clear
      indicators of their alignment status.

    - The grouping/indicators are consistent with the RegistrationResult
      data.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: ProjectTreeModel grouping logic.

      - **Test Data**: Mock SQLiteManager and RegistrationProject to
        return specific ScanInfo and RegistrationResult lists (e.g., A-B
        registered, C-D registered, E is independent).

      - **Expected Result**: ProjectTreeModel::refreshFromDatabase()
        correctly structures the tree with group nodes and child scans.
        data() for group nodes returns appropriate display text (e.g.,
        \"Aligned Pair: A-B\").

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_projecttreemodel.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Scan Grouping.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded scans (A, B).

      - **Expected Result**: User performs manual alignment between A
        and B, then accepts it. Observe the SidebarWidget\'s tree view
        update to show A and B grouped or linked, rather than as
        independent entries.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

- **User Story 4**: As a developer, I want a comprehensive end-to-end
  test for the MVP.

  - **Description**: An automated test is needed to validate that the
    entire manual alignment MVP workflow (from loading to export)
    functions correctly as an integrated system.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Create New Test File**: Create
        tests/integration/manual_alignment_e2e_test.cpp.

    2.  **Initialize Mocks**: Instantiate all necessary mock objects:
        MockMainView, MockE57Parser, MockPointCloudViewer,
        MockPointCloudExporter, MockProjectManager,
        MockPointCloudLoadManager.

    3.  **Initialize Presenter**: Instantiate MainPresenter with the
        mocks.

    4.  **Simulate Workflow Steps**:

        - **Project Setup**: Mock ProjectManager calls for project
          creation.

        - **Scan Loading**: Mock E57Parser to return valid point data.
          Simulate file open dialogs and handleOpenFile() calls.

        - **Manual Alignment**: Directly call
          AlignmentEngine::addCorrespondence() multiple times to create
          pairs. Then call AlignmentEngine::recomputeAlignment().

        - **Finalization**: Call MainPresenter::handleAcceptAlignment().

        - **Export**: Call MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud(). Mock
          MainView::askForSaveFilePath() and PointCloudExporter to
          simulate successful export.

    5.  **Verify Interactions**: Use EXPECT_CALL on mocks to verify that
        all critical methods were called in the correct sequence with
        the expected parameters (e.g., loadPointCloud(),
        setDynamicTransform(), setScanTransform(),
        addRegistrationResult(), exportPointCloudAsync()).

    6.  **Verify Final State**: Assert internal states of MainPresenter
        and RegistrationProject reflect a completed workflow.

  - **References between Files**: This test will interact with almost
    all files and mocks listed in the Actions to Undertake for User
    Stories 1, 2, and 3.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - A new automated test file
      tests/integration/manual_alignment_e2e_test.cpp exists.

    - The test successfully compiles and runs without errors.

    - The test comprehensively simulates the entire MVP workflow for
      manual alignment.

    - All critical interactions between MainPresenter, IMainView,
      IE57Parser, IPointCloudViewer, AlignmentEngine,
      RegistrationProject, and PointCloudExporter are verified.

    - The test confirms that data flows correctly through the system
      (e.g., points loaded, transformed, saved).

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Full Manual Alignment MVP Workflow.

      - **Test Data**:

        - Mock E57 files to return predefined XYZ data for two scans.

        - Known initial transformation for manual alignment points.

        - Mock export path.

      - **Expected Result**: All mock expectations are met, indicating
        correct function calls and parameter passing throughout the
        workflow. The simulated export completes successfully.

      - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Google Mock.

    - Create new file: tests/integration/manual_alignment_e2e_test.cpp.

    - This file will contain the comprehensive integration test as
      outlined in the User Story 4 description.

## References between Files

- **AlignmentControlPanel**: UI for accept/cancel buttons. Interacts
  with MainPresenter.

- **MainPresenter**: Orchestrates the entire workflow. Calls
  AlignmentEngine, RegistrationProject, PointCloudViewerWidget,
  ExportDialog, PointCloudExporter, RegistrationWorkflowWidget, and
  SidebarWidget. Listens to signals from AlignmentEngine,
  RegistrationProject, ExportDialog.

- **AlignmentEngine**: Manages current alignment state and result.

- **RegistrationProject**: Stores and manages scan transformations and
  RegistrationResults. Notifies MainPresenter of changes.

- **PointCloudViewerWidget**: Renders 3D data, handles dynamic previews,
  provides transformed data for export.

- **ExportDialog**: UI for export options. Interacts with MainPresenter
  and PointCloudExporter.

- **PointCloudExporter**: Performs the actual file export.

- **ProjectTreeModel**: Manages the hierarchical data structure for the
  SidebarWidget. Relies on RegistrationProject for grouping information.

- **SidebarWidget**: Displays the ProjectTreeModel in a QTreeView.

- **RegistrationWorkflowWidget**: Manages the overall step-by-step
  workflow navigation.

- **IMainView**: Interface for MainPresenter to interact with MainWindow
  (for dialogs, status bar, etc.).

- **IE57Parser**: (Mocked) for loading scan data.

## List of Files being Created

- **File 1**: tests/integration/manual_alignment_e2e_test.cpp

  - **Purpose**: Comprehensive end-to-end integration test for the
    manual alignment MVP workflow.

  - **Contents**: C++ code using Google Test/Mock to simulate user
    interactions and verify system behavior across multiple components.
    Will use mocks for external services (parsers, exporters) and
    internal modules (IMainView, IPointCloudViewer).

  - **Relationships**: Tests the integration of MainPresenter,
    AlignmentEngine, RegistrationProject, PointCloudViewerWidget,
    ExportDialog, PointCloudExporter, ProjectTreeModel (via
    SidebarWidget), IMainView, IE57Parser (mocks these interfaces).

## Acceptance Criteria

- The \"Accept\" and \"Cancel\" actions for manual alignment are fully
  functional.

- Accepted manual alignments result in the permanent update of scan
  poses within the RegistrationProject.

- A clear RegistrationResult record is stored in the project for each
  accepted alignment.

- The \"Export Point Cloud\" functionality is enabled and successfully
  exports the currently displayed (and transformed) point cloud data in
  various supported formats.

- Export operations display a progress bar and status messages.

- The project tree view in the SidebarWidget visually groups or
  indicates registered scans, clearly showing their relationships.

- A new automated end-to-end integration test for the manual alignment
  MVP passes successfully, verifying the entire workflow.

## Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests**:

  - **test_mainpresenter.cpp**: Cover handleAcceptAlignment(),
    handleCancelAlignment(), handleExportPointCloud() with comprehensive
    mocks.

  - **test_registrationproject.cpp**: Test setScanTransform(),
    addRegistrationResult(), and the new registrationResultAdded signal.

  - **test_pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp**: Test getCurrentPointCloudData()
    returning transformed data.

  - **test_alignmentcontrolpanel.cpp**: Verify button enablement and
    list updates.

  - **test_projecttreemodel.cpp**: Test hierarchical grouping logic for
    registered scans.

- **Integration Test**: manual_alignment_e2e_test.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: Full Manual Alignment Workflow Verification.

    - **Test Data**: Mocked inputs for file paths, point data, and user
      interactions (clicks, dialog selections).

    - **Expected Result**:

      1.  Project opens, scans load (mocked).

      2.  Points are selected, AlignmentEngine calculates transform.

      3.  \"Accept\" is triggered, RegistrationProject updates, viewer
          clears dynamic transform.

      4.  \"Export\" is triggered, ExportDialog appears (mocked),
          PointCloudExporter is invoked with correct data.

      5.  ProjectTreeModel shows updated grouping for registered scans.

    - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Google Mock.

- **Manual QA**:

  - Verify the visual appearance and responsiveness of all new UI
    elements and changes.

  - Perform end-to-end manual alignment and export multiple times with
    different scan data to ensure stability.

  - Visually inspect the project tree for correct grouping.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 1.2 Completion**: All functionality from
  backlog-sprint1-2 (point selection, visual markers, pairing,
  TargetManager storage) is fully implemented and stable.

- **AlignmentEngine Functionality**:
  AlignmentEngine::recomputeAlignment() is stable and correctly computes
  the transformation and RMS error.

- **LeastSquaresAlignment Stability**: The LeastSquaresAlignment
  algorithm is robust and provides accurate transformations.

- **ExportDialog Functionality**: The ExportDialog and
  PointCloudExporter (from Sprint 6) are ready for use and correctly
  handle various export formats and options.

- **RegistrationProject Core**: The RegistrationProject and
  SQLiteManager provide reliable storage for project data, ScanInfo, and
  RegistrationResults.

- **Mock Availability**: Comprehensive mocks for IMainView, IE57Parser,
  IPointCloudViewer, PointCloudExporter, ProjectManager, and
  PointCloudLoadManager are available and configured for testing.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The finalization and export steps should be
  reasonably fast, especially for large point clouds. Transformations
  and file writing should not cause excessive delays.

- **Data Integrity**: Data integrity in RegistrationProject (scan
  transforms, RegistrationResults) must be maintained after
  accept/cancel operations. Exported files must be valid and contain
  accurate data.

- **Usability**: The workflow flow is intuitive, and feedback messages
  are clear and helpful.

- **Stability**: The application should not crash or exhibit unexpected
  behavior during complex operations like export or repeated
  accept/cancel cycles.

- **Memory Management**: Memory usage during export should be managed
  efficiently to avoid out-of-memory errors for large datasets.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 1.3 marks the completion of the MVP. By delivering robust
finalization and export capabilities, along with a comprehensive
end-to-end test, the project will have a fully functional core product
that can be confidently demonstrated and iterated upon in subsequent
sprints. The focus on UI polish and test automation ensures a
high-quality foundation.
