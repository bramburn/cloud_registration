# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 1, Sub-Sprint 1.2 - Point Selection Logic & Visual Feedback

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 1.2: Point
Selection Logic & Visual Feedback. This sub-sprint is a crucial step in
enabling the manual alignment workflow by allowing users to
interactively select corresponding points in 3D space, receive immediate
visual feedback, and store these selections for subsequent alignment
computation.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, when I am in manual alignment mode, I
  want to click on a point in the active scan in the 3D viewer to select
  it.

  - **Description**: This enables direct interaction for point picking
    in the 3D viewer. The system should correctly identify the 3D
    coordinates corresponding to the 2D screen click.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Enhance PointCloudViewerWidget::mousePressEvent**: Modify the
        mousePressEvent to, when in \"Manual Alignment\" mode, capture
        the 2D screen coordinates of the click.

    2.  **Screen-to-World Conversion**: Implement logic within
        PointCloudViewerWidget to convert the 2D screen coordinates and
        depth buffer (or a raycast from camera) into a 3D world
        coordinate.

    3.  **Call NaturalPointSelector**: Pass the 3D ray or a rough 3D
        point (from mouse click) and view parameters to
        NaturalPointSelector::selectPoint() to find the most accurate
        point on the loaded point cloud.

    4.  **Emit Signal**: PointCloudViewerWidget should emit a signal
        (e.g., pointSelected(QVector3D worldPoint, QString scanId))
        containing the 3D coordinates and the ID of the scan the point
        belongs to.

  - **References between Files**:

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.cpp: Implements mousePressEvent logic.

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.h: Defines pointSelected signal and
      necessary internal state for mouse handling.

    - NaturalPointSelector.h/NaturalPointSelector.cpp: selectPoint()
      method will be called to perform the actual point identification.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - When clicking in the PointCloudViewerWidget in manual alignment
      mode, a 3D point on the currently displayed point cloud is
      successfully identified.

    - PointCloudViewerWidget emits a pointSelected signal containing the
      identified 3D point and the scan ID.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Verify PointCloudViewerWidget identifies 3D point
      on click.

      - **Test Data**: A loaded point cloud in PointCloudViewerWidget.
        Mocked mouse click events at various screen positions.

      - **Expected Result**: PointCloudViewerWidget::mousePressEvent
        calls NaturalPointSelector::selectPoint() with correct
        parameters, and pointSelected signal is emitted with valid 3D
        coordinates and scan ID.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp)

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to see visual markers on selected
  points in the 3D viewer.

  - **Description**: This provides immediate visual confirmation to the
    user that their point selection was registered by the application.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Implement PointCloudViewerWidget::drawPointMarker()**: Add a
        private method to PointCloudViewerWidget capable of rendering a
        distinct visual marker (e.g., a small, colored sphere or
        crosshair) at a given 3D position.

    2.  **Store Selected Point Markers**: PointCloudViewerWidget needs
        an internal data structure (e.g., QList\<QVector3D\>
        m_selectedPointMarkers) to store the 3D coordinates of selected
        points that need to be rendered.

    3.  **Trigger Marker Rendering**: When MainPresenter receives a
        pointSelected signal and decides to add a marker, it will call a
        public method on PointCloudViewerWidget (e.g.,
        addMarker(QVector3D point)).

    4.  **Integrate with paintGL**: Call drawPointMarker() within
        PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL() to render all stored markers.

  - **References between Files**:

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.h/PointCloudViewerWidget.cpp: New
      drawPointMarker() (private), addMarker() (public), and internal
      storage for markers. paintGL() will call drawPointMarker().

    - MainPresenter.h/MainPresenter.cpp: Will call
      PointCloudViewerWidget::addMarker() after a point is selected.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - After a point is clicked and identified, a visible marker appears
      at its 3D location in the PointCloudViewerWidget.

    - Multiple selected points each display their own distinct marker.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Verify PointCloudViewerWidget renders markers.

      - **Test Data**: A mock PointCloudViewerWidget with predefined 3D
        points to mark.

      - **Expected Result**: addMarker() is called, and the paintGL()
        method renders a visual marker at the specified coordinates.
        (Visual inspection or simulated rendering check).

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp)

- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want the application to track point
  pairs across two scans.

  - **Description**: The system needs to manage the sequence of point
    selections, ensuring one point is from the \"source\" scan and the
    next from the \"target\" scan to form a valid correspondence.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **MainPresenter State Machine**: Introduce internal state in
        MainPresenter (e.g., an enum ManualAlignmentState {
        ExpectingSourcePoint, ExpectingTargetPoint }) to track which
        type of point is expected next.

    2.  **Prompt User**: Update the status bar or a UI label
        (AlignmentControlPanel) to prompt the user (e.g., \"Select point
        in Scan A\", then \"Select corresponding point in Scan B\").

    3.  **Pair Formation**: When MainPresenter receives a pointSelected
        signal, it checks the current state:

        - If ExpectingSourcePoint, it stores the point and transitions
          to ExpectingTargetPoint.

        - If ExpectingTargetPoint, it pairs the current point with the
          previously stored source point, creates a TargetCorrespondence
          object.

        - After pair formation, it transitions back to
          ExpectingSourcePoint for the next pair.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainPresenter.h/MainPresenter.cpp: New internal state, logic for
      pairing points.

    - AlignmentControlPanel.h/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp: QLabel or
      similar to display guidance messages.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - The UI clearly guides the user on which scan to pick the next
      point from (e.g., \"Select point in Scan A\" or \"Select point in
      Scan B\").

    - The system correctly tracks whether a source or target point is
      expected next.

    - Two consecutive valid point selections result in a single logical
      \"pair\" being formed internally.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Verify MainPresenter\'s point pairing logic.

      - **Test Data**: Mock IMainView and IPointCloudViewer. Simulate a
        sequence of pointSelected signals with alternating scan IDs.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter correctly transitions its
        internal state between expecting source and target points, and
        prompts the user accordingly.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

- **User Story 4**: As a user, I want point pairs to be stored in the
  TargetManager.

  - **Description**: Once a valid source-target point pair is formed, it
    needs to be persistently stored within the project\'s data structure
    so it can be used for alignment computation.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Call TargetManager::addTargetCorrespondence()**: After a
        TargetCorrespondence object is formed (from User Story 3),
        MainPresenter will call
        TargetManager::addCorrespondence(correspondence).

    2.  **TargetCorrespondence Content**: Ensure the
        TargetCorrespondence struct (already defined in
        src/registration/include/registration/TargetCorrespondence.h) is
        capable of storing the QVector3D coordinates of both the source
        and target points, along with their respective scanIds.

    3.  **TargetManager Integration**: Confirm
        TargetManager::addCorrespondence() properly stores the object
        and handles potential duplicate pairs.

    4.  **Emit correspondenceAdded**: TargetManager should emit a signal
        (e.g., correspondenceAdded(QString targetId1, QString
        targetId2)) to notify other components of the new
        correspondence.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainPresenter.h/MainPresenter.cpp: Calls
      TargetManager::addCorrespondence().

    - TargetManager.h/TargetManager.cpp: Implements addCorrespondence()
      and emits correspondenceAdded signal.

    - TargetCorrespondence.h: Defines the TargetCorrespondence data
      structure.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - Each successfully formed point pair is added to the TargetManager.

    - TargetManager emits a correspondenceAdded signal for each new
      pair.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Verify MainPresenter adds correspondences to
      TargetManager.

      - **Test Data**: Mock TargetManager. Simulate a sequence of
        pointSelected signals that form a valid pair.

      - **Expected Result**: TargetManager::addCorrespondence() is
        called with a correctly formed TargetCorrespondence object.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: Verify TargetManager stores and emits.

      - **Test Data**: N/A (unit test on TargetManager directly).

      - **Expected Result**: addCorrespondence() successfully stores the
        object internally and emits correspondenceAdded.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_targetmanager.cpp)

- **User Story 5**: As a user, I want to see a list of all selected
  point pairs in the UI.

  - **Description**: This provides a central place for the user to
    review all currently selected correspondence points, which is
    critical for managing manual alignment.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Modify AlignmentControlPanel**: Add a QTableWidget or
        QListWidget to the AlignmentControlPanel dedicated to displaying
        point correspondences.

    2.  **Display Correspondence Data**: Each entry in the list/table
        should show relevant information, such as \"Pair X\", \"Scan A
        Point (X,Y,Z)\", \"Scan B Point (X,Y,Z)\".

    3.  **Dynamic Update**: MainPresenter listens to
        TargetManager::correspondenceAdded signals. Upon receiving this
        signal, it calls
        AlignmentControlPanel::updateCorrespondenceList() to refresh the
        display with the latest list of correspondences from
        TargetManager::getAllCorrespondences().

    4.  **Initial Population**: When the \"Manual Alignment\" mode is
        entered, AlignmentControlPanel should be populated with any
        existing correspondences from TargetManager.

  - **References between Files**:

    - AlignmentControlPanel.h/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp: New
      QTableWidget/QListWidget, updateCorrespondenceList() method.

    - MainPresenter.h/MainPresenter.cpp: Listens to TargetManager
      signals, calls AlignmentControlPanel::updateCorrespondenceList().

    - TargetManager.h/TargetManager.cpp: getAllCorrespondences() method
      to retrieve data for display.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - A dedicated section in AlignmentControlPanel displays a list of
      selected point correspondences.

    - Each item in the list shows the point data for both the source and
      target scans.

    - The list updates dynamically as new point pairs are added.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Verify AlignmentControlPanel displays and updates
      list.

      - **Test Data**: Mock TargetManager. Simulate adding multiple
        TargetCorrespondence objects to TargetManager.

      - **Expected Result**: AlignmentControlPanel\'s list correctly
        displays all added correspondences with their respective data.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_alignmentcontrolpanel.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Point Selection and List Display.

      - **Test Data**: Application with loaded scans.

      - **Expected Result**: Launch app, start manual alignment, click
        points in viewer. Observe visual markers appearing in 3D viewer
        and new entries appearing in the AlignmentControlPanel list with
        correct point data.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation or UI
        automation script).

## Actions to Undertake

1.  **Frontend (UI Components)**:

    - **PointCloudViewerWidget**:

      - Modify mousePressEvent in
        src/rendering/src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp to:

        - Check if in \"Manual Alignment\" mode.

        - Perform raycasting or closest point search to convert screen
          coordinates to 3D world coordinates.

        - Call NaturalPointSelector::selectPoint() to get the precise
          point on the visible point cloud.

        - Emit a new pointSelected(QVector3D worldPoint, QString scanId)
          signal.

      - Add public method void addPointMarker(QVector3D position, QColor
        color = Qt::yellow); in
        src/rendering/include/rendering/pointcloudviewerwidget.h.

      - Implement addPointMarker() to store marker data (e.g., in
        QList\<QVector3D\> m_pointMarkers;) and paintGL() to render
        these markers.

    - **AlignmentControlPanel**:

      - Add a QTableWidget or QListWidget (m_correspondenceListWidget)
        in src/ui/src/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp to display point pairs.

      - Add a public method void updateCorrespondenceList(const
        QList\<TargetCorrespondence\>& correspondences); in
        src/ui/include/ui/AlignmentControlPanel.h.

      - Update the QLabel that prompts the user (e.g.,
        m_correspondenceStatusLabel) to provide dynamic guidance on
        which scan to pick next.

2.  **Backend (Core Logic/Services)**:

    - **MainPresenter**:

      - Modify handleStartManualAlignmentClicked() in
        src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp to initialize internal state
        related to currentScanForSelection (e.g., set to
        ExpectingSourcePoint).

      - Connect PointCloudViewerWidget::pointSelected signal to a new
        MainPresenter::handlePointSelected(QVector3D point, QString
        scanId) slot.

      - Implement handlePointSelected():

        - Logic to alternate between expecting source and target points.

        - Store the first selected point temporarily.

        - When the second point of a pair is selected:

          - Create a TargetCorrespondence object.

          - Call TargetManager::addCorrespondence().

          - Call PointCloudViewerWidget::addPointMarker() for both
            points in the pair.

          - Call AlignmentControlPanel::updateCorrespondenceList() to
            refresh the UI.

        - Update the AlignmentControlPanel\'s guidance label
          (m_correspondenceStatusLabel).

    - **NaturalPointSelector**:

      - Refine NaturalPointSelector::selectPoint(const
        std::vector\<PointFullData\>& points, const QMatrix4x4&
        viewMatrix, const QMatrix4x4& projectionMatrix, const QPoint&
        screenPos, const QSize& viewportSize, float selectionRadius) in
        src/registration/src/NaturalPointSelector.cpp to accurately
        return the 3D world point and potentially other information
        about the selected point (e.g., point index, confidence). The
        existing SelectionResult struct is suitable for this.

    - **TargetManager**:

      - Verify TargetManager::addCorrespondence(const
        TargetCorrespondence& correspondence) in
        src/registration/src/TargetManager.cpp properly stores the
        TargetCorrespondence objects.

      - Ensure TargetManager::getAllCorrespondences() returns the
        complete list for AlignmentControlPanel updates.

      - Ensure TargetManager emits a correspondenceAdded signal upon
        successful addition.

    - **TargetCorrespondence**:

      - Verify the TargetCorrespondence struct in
        src/registration/include/registration/TargetCorrespondence.h
        contains fields to store the source and target QVector3D points
        themselves (not just their IDs), e.g., QVector3D sourcePoint;
        QVector3D targetPoint;. (Current definition has targetId1,
        targetId2, scanId1, scanId2 but not actual QVector3D points for
        correspondences. This will need modification from
        Target::position() lookup to direct storage.)

## List of Files being Created

- No new files for new components in this sub-sprint. Existing files
  will be modified.

## Acceptance Criteria

- When in manual alignment mode, clicking in the PointCloudViewerWidget
  accurately identifies a 3D point on the loaded point cloud.

- Selected points are visually marked in the PointCloudViewerWidget
  (e.g., distinct colored spheres) immediately after selection.

- The UI (e.g., status bar, a label in AlignmentControlPanel) clearly
  guides the user on which scan to pick the next point from (\"Select
  point in Scan A\", then \"Select point in Scan B\").

- Successfully selected point pairs (one from Scan A, one from Scan B)
  are internally represented as TargetCorrespondence objects, correctly
  storing their 3D coordinates and scan IDs.

- Each TargetCorrespondence object is successfully added to the
  TargetManager.

- A dedicated list/table within the AlignmentControlPanel dynamically
  displays all added TargetCorrespondence objects, showing their
  QVector3D coordinates for both source and target points.

## Testing Plan

- **Unit Test**: test_pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: Verify 3D point identification and marker
    rendering.

    - **Test Data**: Load a mock point cloud. Simulate mouse clicks at
      specific 2D screen coordinates.

    - **Expected Result**: PointCloudViewerWidget correctly translates
      2D clicks to 3D world points (verified by calling mocked
      NaturalPointSelector with known 3D output for a given 2D input).
      addPointMarker() is called, and visual markers are drawn in
      paintGL().

    - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test

  - **Test Case 2**: Verify pointSelected signal emission.

    - **Test Data**: A mock PointCloudViewerWidget.

    - **Test Data**: A small, defined 3D point cloud. Call selectPoint()
      with specific camera/projection matrices and 2D coordinates known
      to target a specific point.

    - **Expected Result**: selectPoint() returns the correct 3D point
      coordinates (within a small tolerance).

    - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test

      calls), and TargetManager (for addCorrespondence calls and
      correspondenceAdded signal). Simulate a sequence of pointSelected
      signals (alternating scan IDs).

    - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter correctly calls
      TargetManager::addCorrespondence() after two points are selected
      (one from each scan). PointCloudViewerWidget::addPointMarker() is
      called for both points. AlignmentControlPanel\'s status label is
      updated with correct prompts.

    - **Testing Tool**: Google Mock / Qt Test

- **Unit Test**: test_targetmanager.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: Verify addCorrespondence() and
    getAllCorrespondences().

    - **Test Data**: Create multiple TargetCorrespondence objects with
      QVector3D data.

      objects. getAllCorrespondences() returns the correct list of
      stored objects. correspondenceAdded signal is emitted.

    - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test

- **Unit Test**: test_alignmentcontrolpanel.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: Verify updateCorrespondenceList() populates
    QTableWidget.

    - **Test Data**: A QList\<TargetCorrespondence\> containing sample

      (verified by checking row/column counts and cell contents).

    - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test

- **Integration Test**: Manual Point Picking & List Display End-to-End.

  - **Test Case 1**: Full workflow simulation.

    - **Test Data**: A project with two loaded scans (e.g., scan_A,
      scan_B).

    - **Expected Result**:

      1.  Launch application and load scans.

      2.  Click \"Start Manual Alignment\".

      3.  Click a point in scan_A in the 3D viewer. Observe a marker
          appear on the point and a prompt to select a point in scan_B.

      4.  Click a point in scan_B in the 3D viewer. Observe a marker
          appear, and a new row appears in AlignmentControlPanel\'s list
          showing the coordinates of both points.

      5.  Repeat for multiple pairs.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI Automation Script.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 1.1 Completion**: The UI mode activation and basic viewer
  readiness (from backlog-sprint1-1) are assumed to be complete.

- **Qt QVector3D in TargetCorrespondence**: It\'s crucial that
  TargetCorrespondence can directly store QVector3D point data, not just
  IDs, for the LeastSquaresAlignment in later sprints.

- **Point Cloud Data in Viewer**: The PointCloudViewerWidget has loaded
  point cloud data available for interaction and can identify points on
  it.

- **Scan Identification**: The PointCloudViewerWidget can determine
  which logical \"scan\" a clicked 3D point belongs to, even if multiple
  point clouds are displayed. This might involve internal state or a
  mapping provided by MainPresenter.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Point picking (selectPoint() and marker rendering)
  should be performant for dense point clouds, ensuring a smooth user
  experience without noticeable lag.

- **Accuracy**: The selected 3D point should be highly accurate to the
  user\'s click, even for very small points or dense areas.

- **Usability**: The visual feedback for point selection (markers,
  prompts) must be clear and unambiguous, guiding the user through the
  process.

- **Data Integrity**: Stored TargetCorrespondence objects must
  accurately represent the selected point pairs and their associated
  scanIds.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 1.2 is fundamental to enabling interactive manual
registration. By allowing users to select points visually and track
these selections, it sets the stage for the crucial alignment
computation in subsequent sprints. The focus on clear visual feedback
and robust data storage will ensure a solid foundation for the MVP.
