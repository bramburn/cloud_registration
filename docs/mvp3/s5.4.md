# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 5, Sub-Sprint 5.4 - Target-Based Alignment Computation

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 5.4:
Target-Based Alignment Computation. This sub-sprint focuses on
integrating the core logic for calculating rigid transformations between
two scans using detected or manually selected targets. It leverages the
existing LeastSquaresAlignment algorithm and TargetManager to enable
automated target-based registration.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, after detecting targets in multiple
  scans, I want to automatically compute the alignment between them
  using these targets.

  - **Description**: This user story enables the primary function of
    target-based registration: taking a set of corresponding targets
    from two scans and computing a precise alignment. The system should
    identify matching targets and feed them to the alignment algorithm.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Add \"Compute Target Alignment\" Button**: In
        src/ui/src/TargetDetectionDialog.cpp (or a new
        TargetAlignmentPanel if it separates from detection), add a
        QPushButton labeled \"Compute Target Alignment\".

    2.  **Button Enablement Logic**: Implement logic to enable this
        button only when TargetManager indicates that targets exist for
        *at least two* distinct scans, and a minimum number of
        correspondences (e.g., 3 non-collinear targets) can be formed
        between them. Initially, simply check for targets on 2+ scans.

    3.  **Connect Button to MainPresenter**: Connect the clicked signal
        of this button to a new public slot in MainPresenter:
        handleComputeTargetAlignment().

    4.  **Implement MainPresenter::handleComputeTargetAlignment()**:

        - Retrieve the sourceScanId and targetScanId (e.g., from current
          project selection or TargetDetectionDialog\'s internal state).

        - Call AlignmentEngine::startTargetBasedAlignment(sourceScanId,
          targetScanId).

        - Display status message (e.g., \"Computing Target
          Alignment\...\").

  - **References between Files**:

    - TargetDetectionDialog.h / TargetDetectionDialog.cpp: Adds
      \"Compute Target Alignment\" button, manages its enabled state.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Adds
      handleComputeTargetAlignment() slot. Calls
      AlignmentEngine::startTargetBasedAlignment(). Needs to know
      current sourceScanId and targetScanId.

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp: Adds
      startTargetBasedAlignment() method.

    - TargetManager.h / TargetManager.cpp: Provides methods to query
      targets (e.g., getTargetsForScan()).

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - A \"Compute Target Alignment\" button is visible in the
      TargetDetectionDialog.

    - The button is enabled only when targets have been
      detected/selected for at least two distinct scans.

    - Clicking the button invokes
      MainPresenter::handleComputeTargetAlignment().

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Button enablement.

      - **Test Data**: Mock TargetManager to simulate scenarios (no
        targets, targets on 1 scan, targets on 2+ scans).

      - **Expected Result**: Button disabled for \<2 scans with targets;
        enabled for \>=2 scans with targets.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_targetdetectiondialog.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: Button click triggers MainPresenter.

      - **Test Data**: N/A (mock MainPresenter).

      - **Expected Result**: Clicking the button calls
        MainPresenter::handleComputeTargetAlignment().

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_targetdetectiondialog.cpp).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to see a live preview of the
  alignment in the 3D viewer.

  - **Description**: After the target-based alignment is computed, the
    user should immediately see the resulting transformation applied
    dynamically in the 3D viewer. This visual feedback helps confirm the
    correctness of the alignment before final commitment.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Backend Computation**: In
        AlignmentEngine::startTargetBasedAlignment():

        - **Retrieve Targets**: Get QList\<std::shared_ptr\<Target\>\>
          for sourceScanId and targetScanId from TargetManager.

        - **Find Correspondences**: Implement a new helper method
          AlignmentEngine::findTargetCorrespondences(const
          QList\<std::shared_ptr\<Target\>\>& sourceTargets, const
          QList\<std::shared_ptr\<Target\>\>& targetTargets) that
          attempts to match targets (e.g., by type and proximity for
          spheres, or by ID for manual points). This method should
          return QList\<QPair\<QVector3D, QVector3D\>\> suitable for
          LeastSquaresAlignment.

        - **Call LeastSquaresAlignment**: Pass the found correspondences
          to LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation().

        - **Store Result**: Store the resulting TransformationMatrix and
          rmsError in AlignmentEngine::m_currentResult.

        - **Emit Signal**: Emit
          AlignmentEngine::alignmentResultUpdated(m_currentResult)
          (similar to manual alignment).

    2.  **MainPresenter Relays to Viewer**:
        MainPresenter::handleAlignmentResultUpdated() (connected to
        AlignmentEngine::alignmentResultUpdated) will pass the
        TransformationMatrix to
        PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform() for the \"moving\"
        scan.

    3.  **PointCloudViewerWidget Dynamic Update**:
        PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform() (implemented in
        S2.2) will handle rendering the preview.

  - **References between Files**:

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp:
      startTargetBasedAlignment() (new), findTargetCorrespondences()
      (new helper). Emits alignmentResultUpdated.

    - TargetManager.h / TargetManager.cpp: getTargetsForScan().

    - Target.h: Base class for SphereTarget, NaturalPointTarget (for
      matching logic).

    - LeastSquaresAlignment.h / LeastSquaresAlignment.cpp:
      computeTransformation() (core algorithm).

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp:
      handleAlignmentResultUpdated() (receives signal), calls
      PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform().

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.h / PointCloudViewerWidget.cpp:
      setDynamicTransform() (for dynamic preview).

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - After clicking \"Compute Target Alignment\", the source point
      cloud visibly shifts in the 3D viewer to align with the target
      point cloud.

    - This alignment preview is dynamic and does not permanently alter
      the underlying point cloud data.

    - The transformation is applied only to the designated \"moving\"
      scan.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: AlignmentEngine::findTargetCorrespondences()
      logic.

      - **Test Data**: Prepare lists of mock SphereTarget and
        NaturalPointTarget objects (source and target) with known
        correspondences.

      - **Expected Result**: findTargetCorrespondences() returns a
        QList\<QPair\<QVector3D, QVector3D\>\> with the correct 3D point
        pairs.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_alignmentengine.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: AlignmentEngine::startTargetBasedAlignment()
      computation.

      - **Test Data**: Mock TargetManager to return known targets. Mock
        LeastSquaresAlignment to return a known transformation.

      - **Expected Result**: startTargetBasedAlignment() calls
        findTargetCorrespondences() and
        LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation(), then emits
        alignmentResultUpdated.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_alignmentengine.cpp).

    - **Test Case 3**: End-to-End Live Preview.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, misaligned scans,
        each with detected/manual targets forming a known correspondence
        (e.g., 3 spheres or 3 manual points).

      - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Compute Target Alignment\".
        The source scan immediately snaps into alignment with the target
        scan in the 3D viewer.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want to see the quality metrics (e.g.,
  RMS error) for the target-based alignment.

  - **Description**: Numerical feedback on the accuracy of the
    target-based alignment is crucial for evaluating its quality. This
    information should be displayed in the UI.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Populate AlignmentResult**: Ensure
        AlignmentEngine::startTargetBasedAlignment() accurately
        calculates and populates
        AlignmentEngine::m_currentResult.errorStats (including rmsError,
        meanError, maxError) using
        ErrorAnalysis::calculateErrorStatistics().

    2.  **MainPresenter Relays Metrics**:
        MainPresenter::handleAlignmentResultUpdated() (from S2.2 and
        S4.3) will receive the AlignmentResult and call
        AlignmentControlPanel::updateAlignmentResult() (from S2.2) to
        update its quality metrics display.

  - **References between Files**:

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp:
      startTargetBasedAlignment() populates AlignmentResult::errorStats.

    - ErrorAnalysis.h / ErrorAnalysis.cpp: calculateErrorStatistics()
      used by AlignmentEngine.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp:
      handleAlignmentResultUpdated() relays to AlignmentControlPanel.

    - AlignmentControlPanel.h / AlignmentControlPanel.cpp:
      updateAlignmentResult() (displays metrics).

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - After \"Compute Target Alignment\" is clicked, the
      AlignmentControlPanel displays the calculated RMS error, mean
      error, and max error for the target-based alignment.

    - The displayed metrics accurately reflect the results of the
      AlignmentEngine.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: AlignmentEngine calculates and populates error
      stats.

      - **Test Data**: Provide mock TargetManager returning specific
        targets.

      - **Expected Result**: startTargetBasedAlignment() calculates
        ErrorStatistics correctly (e.g., with mock LeastSquaresAlignment
        returning a known transformation that leads to known errors).

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_alignmentengine.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Metrics Display.

      - **Test Data**: Application with loaded scans and targets. User
        initiates target-based alignment.

      - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Compute Target Alignment\".
        The AlignmentControlPanel immediately displays the RMS and other
        quality metrics.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

## Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)

1.  **Frontend (UI Components)**:

    - **TargetDetectionDialog (src/ui/src/TargetDetectionDialog.cpp and
      src/ui/include/ui/TargetDetectionDialog.h)**:

      - Add QPushButton\* m_computeAlignmentButton; (e.g., in the
        \"Results\" tab or a new \"Alignment\" tab).

      - Implement logic to enable m_computeAlignmentButton: It should be
        enabled if TargetManager has targets for at least two scans that
        are currently selected/active.

      - Connect its clicked signal to
        MainPresenter::handleComputeTargetAlignment().

    - **AlignmentControlPanel (src/ui/src/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp)**:

      - The display of RMS and other metrics is already handled by
        updateAlignmentResult() (from S2.2). Ensure this method can
        correctly handle AlignmentResult originating from target-based
        alignment.

2.  **Backend (Core Logic/Services)**:

    - **AlignmentEngine (src/registration/AlignmentEngine.h /
      src/registration/AlignmentEngine.cpp)**:

      - Add public method: void startTargetBasedAlignment(const QString&
        sourceScanId, const QString& targetScanId);

      - Implement startTargetBasedAlignment():

        - Get sourceTargets =
          m_targetManager-\>getTargetsForScan(sourceScanId);

        - Get targetTargets =
          m_targetManager-\>getTargetsForScan(targetScanId);

        - Call QList\<QPair\<QVector3D, QVector3D\>\> correspondences =
          findTargetCorrespondences(sourceTargets, targetTargets); (New
          helper method).

        - **Error Handling**: Check if correspondences.size() is less
          than 3. If so, set m_currentResult.state =
          AlignmentState::Insufficient, m_currentResult.message =
          \"Insufficient corresponding targets.\", emit
          alignmentResultUpdated(), and return.

        - Call QMatrix4x4 transformation =
          LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation(correspondences);

        - Call ErrorAnalysis::ErrorStatistics errorStats =
          ErrorAnalysis::calculateErrorStatistics(correspondences,
          transformation); (This might involve transforming source
          points by transformation first).

        - Set m_currentResult.transformation = transformation;,
          m_currentResult.errorStats = errorStats;,
          m_currentResult.state = AlignmentState::Valid;,
          m_currentResult.algorithm = \"TargetBased\";.

        - Emit alignmentResultUpdated(m_currentResult);.

      - Add private helper method: QList\<QPair\<QVector3D,
        QVector3D\>\> findTargetCorrespondences(const
        QList\<std::shared_ptr\<Target\>\>& sourceTargets, const
        QList\<std::shared_ptr\<Target\>\>& targetTargets);

        - Implement findTargetCorrespondences():

          - For MVP: Match targets by type (e.g., SphereTarget to
            SphereTarget, NaturalPointTarget to NaturalPointTarget).

          - For spheres: Match based on approximate position and radius.
            Use a simple nearest-neighbor search for spheres if their
            positions are close.

          - For natural points: If they have IDs, match by ID. If not,
            use proximity or feature descriptors (more advanced,
            potentially for later sprints). For MVP, assume manual
            selection or fixed IDs for correspondence.

          - Return QList\<QPair\<QVector3D, QVector3D\>\> of
            corresponding 3D points.

    - **LeastSquaresAlignment**: No changes.

    - **ErrorAnalysis**: No changes.

    - **TargetManager**: Ensure getTargetsForScan() correctly returns
      the list of std::shared_ptr\<Target\>.

## List of Files being Created

- No new files are created in this sub-sprint. All changes occur in
  existing files.

## Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated)

- A \"Compute Target Alignment\" button is present in the
  TargetDetectionDialog (or a dedicated alignment panel).

- The \"Compute Target Alignment\" button is enabled only when targets
  have been detected/added for at least two distinct scans.

- Clicking the button initiates the target-based alignment computation.

- The system successfully identifies corresponding targets between the
  source and target scans.

- LeastSquaresAlignment is invoked with the correct corresponding point
  pairs.

- The 3D viewer displays a live, dynamic preview of the alignment, where
  the source scan shifts relative to the target scan.

- The AlignmentControlPanel\'s \"Quality Metrics\" section updates to
  display the calculated RMS error, mean error, and max error for the
  target-based alignment.

- If insufficient corresponding targets are found (\<3), an informative
  error message is displayed, and no alignment is computed.

## Testing Plan (Consolidated)

- **Unit Test**: test_alignmentengine.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: findTargetCorrespondences() - perfect match.

    - **Test Data**: Lists of SphereTargets (source and target) with
      identical positions/radii.

    - **Expected Result**: Returns QList\<QPair\<QVector3D,
      QVector3D\>\> containing correct corresponding point pairs.

  - **Test Case 2**: findTargetCorrespondences() - no
    match/insufficient.

    - **Test Data**: Lists of targets with no correspondence, or only
      1-2 matches.

    - **Expected Result**: Returns an empty list or a list with \<3
      pairs.

  - **Test Case 3**: startTargetBasedAlignment() - successful
    computation.

    - **Test Data**: Mock TargetManager to return target lists that
      result in 3+ valid correspondences. Mock LeastSquaresAlignment to
      return a known transformation. Mock ErrorAnalysis.

    - **Expected Result**: findTargetCorrespondences() is called,
      LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation() is called,
      ErrorAnalysis::calculateErrorStatistics() is called, and
      alignmentResultUpdated is emitted with a Valid state and correct
      metrics.

  - **Test Case 4**: startTargetBasedAlignment() - insufficient
    correspondences.

    - **Test Data**: Mock TargetManager to return target lists that
      result in \<3 valid correspondences.

    - **Expected Result**: alignmentResultUpdated is emitted with
      AlignmentState::Insufficient and a corresponding message. No call
      to LeastSquaresAlignment.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Google Mock.

- **Integration Test**: Target-Based Alignment Workflow.

  - **Test Case 1**: Successful target-based alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, misaligned scans.
      Ensure targets are detected/added on both scans that form valid
      correspondences (e.g., 3+ unique spheres on each, with known
      relationships).

    - **Expected Result**:

      1.  User launches TargetDetectionDialog.

      2.  Targets are detected (or manually added) on both scan_A and
          scan_B.

      3.  \"Compute Target Alignment\" button becomes enabled.

      4.  User clicks \"Compute Target Alignment\".

      5.  The source scan visibly aligns with the target scan in the 3D
          viewer.

      6.  The AlignmentControlPanel updates with RMS and other quality
          metrics.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script.

  - **Test Case 2**: Insufficient Targets for Alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded scans. Only 1 or 2
      targets are detected/added on each scan, or targets that cannot
      form valid correspondences.

    - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Compute Target Alignment\". An
      error/warning message is displayed (e.g., \"Insufficient
      corresponding targets\"), and no alignment preview occurs.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 5.3 Completion**: All functionality from Sub-Sprint 5.3
  (Viewer Integration & Target Visualization) is fully implemented and
  stable, including TargetManager storing SphereTarget and
  NaturalPointTarget objects, and their rendering in the viewer.

- **LeastSquaresAlignment Reliability**: The
  LeastSquaresAlignment::computeTransformation() is accurate and stable.

- **ErrorAnalysis Reliability**:
  ErrorAnalysis::calculateErrorStatistics() accurately computes metrics
  for point correspondences.

- **Target Matching Logic (MVP)**: For this sprint,
  findTargetCorrespondences() can use simple heuristics (e.g., same
  type, closest proximity, or matching IDs for manually selected points)
  to establish correspondences. More advanced feature matching is out of
  scope.

- **PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform()**: This method (from
  S2.2) is fully functional for live preview.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Target-based alignment computation should be fast, as
  it typically involves a small number of correspondences.

- **Accuracy**: The computed alignment should be accurate given correct
  target correspondences.

- **Usability**: The \"Compute Target Alignment\" button\'s enablement
  logic provides clear guidance. Error messages for insufficient targets
  are informative.

- **Robustness**: The system should handle cases where target
  correspondences are insufficient or problematic gracefully, without
  crashing.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 5.4 delivers the core computational engine for target-based
registration. By enabling automatic alignment based on detected
features, it significantly enhances the application\'s automation
capabilities, moving closer to the Minimum Competitive Product.
