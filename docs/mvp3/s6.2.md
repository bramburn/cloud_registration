# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 6, Sub-Sprint 6.2 - PDF Report Generation UI & Backend Hookup

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 6.2: PDF Report
Generation UI & Backend Hookup. This sub-sprint focuses on integrating
the PDFReportGenerator into the application\'s UI, allowing users to
create comprehensive quality reports in PDF format based on their
registration results. This is a critical feature for professional output
and is part of the Minimum Competitive Product (MCP).

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, after assessing registration quality, I
  want to generate a detailed PDF report.

  - **Description**: This user story enables the creation of a
    professional document summarizing the project\'s registration
    quality. It involves triggering the report generation and saving the
    output to a specified file.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Enable \"Generate Quality Report\" Action**: In
        src/app/src/mainwindow.cpp, ensure the m_generateReportAction in
        the \"File\" or \"Quality\" menu is enabled only when a project
        is open, a registration has been accepted, and a quality
        assessment (QualityAssessment) has been performed. This implies
        MainPresenter should store the last QualityReport generated.

    2.  **Connect Menu Action**: Connect the triggered signal of
        m_generateReportAction to a new public slot
        MainPresenter::handleGenerateReportClicked().

    3.  **Implement MainPresenter::handleGenerateReportClicked()**:

        - In src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp, implement this slot.

        - **Pre-check**: Verify that MainPresenter has a valid
          m_lastQualityReport available. If not (e.g., no quality
          assessment has been run yet for the current registration),
          display an error message using
          IMainView::displayErrorMessage().

        - **Prompt for Save Path**: Call
          IMainView::askForSaveFilePath(\"Save Quality Report\",
          \"Quality Report (\*.pdf)\") to get the desired output PDF
          file path from the user. Provide a sensible default filename
          (e.g., \[ProjectName\]\_QualityReport.pdf). If the user
          cancels, return.

        - **Instantiate PDFReportGenerator**: Create an instance of
          PDFReportGenerator (src/export/PDFReportGenerator.cpp).

        - **Prepare ReportOptions**: Create a
          PDFReportGenerator::ReportOptions struct. For this sub-sprint,
          populate it with basic options like outputPath, projectName
          (from RegistrationProject), and operatorName (can be hardcoded
          or from preferences for now). Other options (charts,
          screenshots) can be default false.

        - **Trigger Report Generation**: Call
          pdfGenerator.generatePdfReport(m_lastQualityReport, options).

        - **Handle Completion**: Listen to
          PDFReportGenerator::reportGenerated (success) or reportError
          (failure) signals. In the connected slot, display
          success/failure messages using IMainView::displayInfoMessage()
          or IMainView::displayErrorMessage().

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainWindow.h / MainWindow.cpp: m_generateReportAction (enablement
      logic, connection to MainPresenter).

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Adds
      handleGenerateReportClicked() slot. Stores m_lastQualityReport.
      Calls IMainView::askForSaveFilePath(),
      PDFReportGenerator::generatePdfReport(). Listens to
      PDFReportGenerator signals.

    - IMainView.h / IMainView.cpp (MainWindow implements this):
      askForSaveFilePath(), displayInfoMessage(), displayErrorMessage().

    - PDFReportGenerator.h / PDFReportGenerator.cpp: generatePdfReport()
      method, ReportOptions struct, reportGenerated, reportError
      signals.

    - QualityAssessment.h: Defines QualityReport struct.

    - RegistrationProject.h: Provides projectName().

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - The \"Generate Quality Report\" menu item is correctly enabled
      only after a project is open, a registration is accepted, and a
      quality assessment for that registration has been performed.

    - Clicking the menu item launches a standard file save dialog,
      prompting the user for a PDF filename and location.

    - A PDF file is successfully generated at the specified location
      with a basic report (containing at least project name, operator
      name, and the main RMS/error statistics from QualityReport).

    - A success or failure message is displayed to the user after report
      generation.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: \"Generate Quality Report\" action enablement.

      - **Test Data**: Mock MainPresenter to simulate different states
        (no project, no registration, registration without assessment,
        registration with assessment).

      - **Expected Result**: Action is enabled only when
        m_lastQualityReport in MainPresenter is valid and a project is
        open.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: Report generation initiation.

      - **Test Data**: Mock IMainView (to return a mock file path). Mock
        PDFReportGenerator (to verify generatePdfReport() call and
        signal emission).

      - **Expected Result**: handleGenerateReportClicked() calls
        askForSaveFilePath() and then
        PDFReportGenerator::generatePdfReport() with the
        m_lastQualityReport and a basic ReportOptions struct.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 3**: PDFReportGenerator creates basic PDF.

      - **Test Data**: Provide a simple QualityReport struct. Provide a
        dummy output file path.

      - **Expected Result**: generatePdfReport() successfully creates a
        PDF file at the specified path. The PDF contains basic text
        derived from the QualityReport (e.g., RMS value).

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_pdfreportgenerator.cpp - this
        is test_quality_reporting.cpp from the previous plan).

    - **Test Case 4**: End-to-End Report Generation.

      - **Test Data**: Application with loaded scans, successful manual
        alignment, and quality assessment performed (from Sprint 6.1, or
        mocked).

      - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Generate Quality Report\".
        Selects a path. A PDF file is created, and a success message
        appears. (Manual check of PDF content).

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation and
        external PDF viewer).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want the system to link quality
  assessment to report generation.

  - **Description**: The PDF report should be based on the most recently
    calculated quality metrics for the current active registration. This
    involves ensuring that MainPresenter stores the QualityReport
    whenever QualityAssessment completes.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Store QualityReport in MainPresenter**:

        - In src/app/include/app/MainPresenter.h, add a private member:
          QualityReport m_lastQualityReport;.

        - In src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp, in the slot connected to
          QualityAssessment::assessmentCompleted(QualityReport result)
          (e.g., handleQualityAssessmentCompleted()), store the result
          in m_lastQualityReport.

    2.  **Enable Report Action**: When m_lastQualityReport is updated
        and valid, trigger m_generateReportAction-\>setEnabled(true) via
        IMainView.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Stores m_lastQualityReport.
      Connects to QualityAssessment::assessmentCompleted.

    - QualityAssessment.h / QualityAssessment.cpp: Emits
      assessmentCompleted(QualityReport result).

    - MainWindow.h / MainWindow.cpp: Receives enablement signal from
      MainPresenter for m_generateReportAction.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - After a quality assessment is performed, the \"Generate Quality
      Report\" menu item becomes enabled.

    - The generated PDF report uses the data from the most recently
      completed quality assessment.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: MainPresenter stores and enables.

      - **Test Data**: Mock QualityAssessment to emit
        assessmentCompleted with a dummy QualityReport.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter::m_lastQualityReport is
        updated, and
        IMainView::setActionsEnabled(m_generateReportAction, true) is
        called.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Linkage.

      - **Test Data**: Application with loaded and aligned scans.

      - **Expected Result**: User performs manual/ICP/target-based
        alignment and accepts it. Then user explicitly triggers a
        quality assessment (if not automatic). Observe that \"Generate
        Quality Report\" becomes enabled, and the generated PDF uses the
        just-calculated metrics.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

## Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)

1.  **Frontend (UI Components)**:

    - **MainWindow (src/app/src/mainwindow.cpp)**:

      - Add QAction\* m_generateReportAction; to File or Quality menu.

      - In setupActions(): m_generateReportAction-\>setText(\"Generate
        Quality Report\...\");
        m_generateReportAction-\>setEnabled(false);

      - Connect m_generateReportAction\'s triggered() signal to
        MainPresenter::handleGenerateReportClicked().

    - **MainPresenter (src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp and
      src/app/include/app/MainPresenter.h)**:

      - Add QualityReport m_lastQualityReport; as a private member.

      - Add void handleGenerateReportClicked(); public slot.

      - Add void onQualityAssessmentCompleted(const QualityReport&
        report); private slot. (Connect to
        QualityAssessment::assessmentCompleted).

      - In onQualityAssessmentCompleted():

        - m_lastQualityReport = report;

        - m_view-\>setActionsEnabled(m_generateReportAction, true);
          (Assuming IMainView has this method).

      - In handleGenerateReportClicked():

        - Check m_lastQualityReport.isValid() (add isValid() to
          QualityReport if not exists). If false, display error and
          return.

        - QString filePath = m_view-\>askForSaveFilePath(\"Save Quality
          Report\", \"PDF files (\*.pdf)\");

        - If filePath.isEmpty(), return.

        - PDFReportGenerator generator;

        - PDFReportGenerator::ReportOptions options;

        - options.outputPath = filePath;

        - options.projectName = m_currentProject-\>projectName();
          (Assume m_currentProject is available).

        - options.operatorName = \"Default User\"; (Hardcoded for now).

        - connect(&generator, &PDFReportGenerator::reportGenerated,
          this, &MainPresenter::onReportGenerated); (New slot).

        - connect(&generator, &PDFReportGenerator::reportError, this,
          &MainPresenter::onReportError); (New slot).

        - generator.generatePdfReport(m_lastQualityReport, options);

      - Add private slots void onReportGenerated(const QString&
        filePath); and void onReportError(const QString& error);.

      - In these slots, use m_view-\>displayInfoMessage() or
        displayErrorMessage().

2.  **Backend (Core Logic/Services)**:

    - **QualityAssessment (src/quality/QualityAssessment.h and
      src/quality/QualityAssessment.cpp)**:

      - Ensure void assessmentCompleted(const QualityReport& result);
        signal is emitted correctly after an assessment.

    - **QualityReport (src/quality/QualityAssessment.h)**:

      - Add bool isValid() const { return !reportTitle.isEmpty(); } or
        similar validation for m_lastQualityReport check.

    - **PDFReportGenerator (src/export/PDFReportGenerator.h and
      src/export/PDFReportGenerator.cpp)**:

      - Ensure void generatePdfReport(const QualityReport& report, const
        ReportOptions& options); is implemented to create a basic PDF
        from the QualityReport.

      - Ensure void reportGenerated(const QString& filePath); and void
        reportError(const QString& error); signals are emitted.

      - **ReportOptions Struct**: Define ReportOptions in
        PDFReportGenerator.h to include outputPath, projectName,
        operatorName. Other fields (includeCharts, includeScreenshots,
        includeRecommendations) can be defaulted to false for this
        sprint.

    - **RegistrationProject**: Ensure projectName() method is available.

## List of Files being Created

- No new files are created in this sub-sprint. All changes occur in
  existing files.

## Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated)

- The \"Generate Quality Report\" menu item is visible and correctly
  enabled/disabled based on the availability of an accepted registration
  and a quality assessment for it.

- Clicking \"Generate Quality Report\" opens a file save dialog for PDF
  output.

- The application successfully generates a basic PDF report at the
  specified location.

- The generated PDF contains the project name, operator name, and the
  main RMS error from the QualityReport.

- A success message is displayed upon successful generation; an error
  message if it fails.

- The MainPresenter correctly stores the QualityReport from the most
  recent quality assessment.

## Testing Plan (Consolidated)

- **Unit Test**: test_mainpresenter.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: \"Generate Report\" action enablement.

      QualityReport, then test m_generateReportAction enabled. Test with
      invalid QualityReport (not enabled).

    - **Expected Result**: Action is enabled/disabled correctly.

  - **Test Case 2**: handleGenerateReportClicked() launches dialog and
    triggers generator.

    - **Test Data**: Mock IMainView (return valid path). Mock
      PDFReportGenerator (verify generatePdfReport call).

    - **Expected Result**: File dialog is prompted, generatePdfReport is
      called with m_lastQualityReport and options.

  - **Test Case 3**: onReportGenerated/onReportError display messages.

    - **Test Data**: Call onReportGenerated / onReportError.

    - **Expected Result**:
      IMainView::displayInfoMessage/displayErrorMessage is called.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Mock / Qt Test.

- **Unit Test**: test_pdfreportgenerator.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: generatePdfReport() creates basic PDF.

    - **Test Data**: A simple QualityReport object. A temporary file
      path.

    - **Expected Result**: A PDF file is created. Content inspection
      (manual or programmatic if simple text) verifies basic
      QualityReport data is present. reportGenerated signal emitted.

  - **Test Case 2**: generatePdfReport() handles errors.

    - **Test Data**: Invalid outputPath.

    - **Expected Result**: reportError signal is emitted.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test.

- **Integration Test**: Quality Reporting Workflow - Report Generation.

  - **Test Case 1**: Full report generation workflow.

    - **Test Data**: Application with loaded scans. User performs manual
      alignment, accepts it. Quality assessment is performed (or mocked
      as completed).

    - **Expected Result**:

      1.  \"Generate Quality Report\" action is enabled.

      2.  User clicks action, selects a save path.

      3.  A success message appears.

      4.  Verify (externally) that the PDF file is created and contains
          project name, operator, and RMS.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script, external PDF
      viewer.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 6.1 Completion (or its core components)**: The
  QualityAssessment component is assumed to be able to compute a
  QualityReport for a given registration, and it emits
  assessmentCompleted signal. (The visual deviation map is not strictly
  required for this, but the QualityReport is).

- **PDFReportGenerator Core**: The PDFReportGenerator class (likely
  leveraging a third-party PDF library) is capable of generating basic
  PDFs.

- **QualityReport Structure**: The QualityReport struct contains all
  necessary data fields (RMS, project info, etc.) for basic reporting.

- **IMainView File Dialogs**: IMainView::askForSaveFilePath() is
  functional.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: The report generation process should be
  straightforward, with clear prompts and feedback.

- **Consistency**: The generated PDF should adhere to a consistent
  branding and layout.

- **Performance**: Report generation should be reasonably fast,
  especially for basic reports (under a few seconds).

- **Robustness**: The application should handle file I/O errors during
  PDF generation gracefully.

- **Quality of Output**: The generated PDF should be
  professional-looking and easily readable.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 6.2 delivers a crucial professional output capability by
integrating PDF quality report generation. This feature provides a
tangible summary of registration quality, significantly enhancing the
application\'s value proposition for the Minimum Competitive Product.
