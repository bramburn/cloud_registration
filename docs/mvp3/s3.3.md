# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 3, Sub-Sprint 3.3 - Project Tree Model Update & Scan Grouping

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 3.3: Project
Tree Model Update & Scan Grouping. This sub-sprint aims to enhance the
usability and clarity of the project structure within the application\'s
sidebar. It focuses on visually representing registered scans in a
hierarchical manner, grouping them to reflect their alignment
relationships.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, when scans are registered, I want to see
  them grouped in the project tree to understand their alignment
  relationships.

  - **Description**: Currently, scans might appear as independent
    entries in the sidebar\'s project tree. When two or more scans are
    registered, they should be visually associated, indicating they form
    an aligned group. This improves clarity and project organization.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Modify ProjectTreeModel::refreshFromDatabase()**:

        - In src/ui/src/projecttreemodel.cpp, enhance the
          refreshFromDatabase() method to not just list individual scans
          but also to detect and group registered scans.

        - **Retrieve Registration Results**: During refresh, obtain all
          RegistrationResult objects from
          RegistrationProject::getRegistrationResults().

        - **Create Group Nodes**: For each unique pair of registered
          scans (source-target from RegistrationResult), create a new
          parent QStandardItem (e.g., named \"Aligned Group: ScanA -
          ScanB\").

        - **Add Scans as Children**: Add the QStandardItems representing
          the individual sourceScanId and targetScanId from the
          RegistrationResult as children under this new group node.

        - **Handle Multiple Registrations**: Consider how to handle
          scans involved in multiple registrations (e.g., A-B, B-C). For
          MVP, simply grouping A-B and B-C separately is acceptable, or
          the first detected group dominates.

    2.  **Update RegistrationProject Signal**: Ensure
        RegistrationProject::addRegistrationResult() in
        src/registration/src/RegistrationProject.cpp emits a signal
        (e.g., registrationResultAdded(const QString& sourceScanId,
        const QString& targetScanId)) after successfully adding a new
        result.

    3.  **Connect MainPresenter to ProjectTreeModel Update**:

        - In src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp, add a slot to listen to
          RegistrationProject::registrationResultAdded.

        - In this slot, call
          m_view-\>getSidebar()-\>refreshFromDatabase() (or a more
          specific ProjectTreeModel::updateScanGrouping()) to trigger
          the tree view update.

    4.  **SidebarWidget Rerendering**: Ensure SidebarWidget
        (src/ui/src/sidebarwidget.cpp) correctly observes changes in its
        model and rerenders the tree view to show the new hierarchy.

  - **References between Files**:

    - ProjectTreeModel.h / ProjectTreeModel.cpp: refreshFromDatabase()
      modified for grouping logic, new QStandardItem types for group
      nodes.

    - RegistrationProject.h / RegistrationProject.cpp:
      getRegistrationResults() (provides data for grouping),
      registrationResultAdded (new signal).

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Listens to
      RegistrationProject signal, triggers SidebarWidget refresh.

    - SidebarWidget.h / SidebarWidget.cpp: Acts as the view for
      ProjectTreeModel, updates display.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - When a new registration is accepted (User Story 1 from S3.1), the
      SidebarWidget\'s project tree automatically updates.

    - Registered scan pairs appear under a common parent node (e.g.,
      \"Aligned Pair: ScanA - ScanB\") or show a visual indicator of
      their alignment status.

    - The grouping/indicators are consistent with the stored
      RegistrationProject::RegistrationResult data.

    - Independent scans continue to be listed individually.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: ProjectTreeModel basic grouping.

      - **Test Data**: Mock SQLiteManager and RegistrationProject to
        return a list of 2 ScanInfos (ScanA, ScanB) and 1
        RegistrationResult (A-B).

      - **Expected Result**: ProjectTreeModel::refreshFromDatabase()
        creates a parent group node with \"ScanA\" and \"ScanB\" as
        children.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_projecttreemodel.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: ProjectTreeModel with multiple groups and
      independent scans.

      - **Test Data**: Mock SQLiteManager and RegistrationProject to
        return:

        - ScanA, ScanB, ScanC, ScanD, ScanE (all ScanInfo)

        - RegistrationResult (A-B)

        - RegistrationResult (C-D)

      - **Expected Result**: Tree shows \"Aligned Group: A-B\" parent
        with A, B children; \"Aligned Group: C-D\" parent with C, D
        children; \"ScanE\" as a top-level independent scan.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_projecttreemodel.cpp)

    - **Test Case 3**: End-to-End Grouping Update.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, misaligned scans.

      - **Expected Result**: User performs manual alignment between
        scan_A and scan_B, then clicks \"Accept\". Observe the
        SidebarWidget\'s tree view update to show scan_A and scan_B
        grouped under a new \"Aligned Pair\" node, or visually linked.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to clearly identify reference and
  target scans within a registered group.

  - **Description**: Within a grouped set of aligned scans, it\'s
    important to distinguish which scan serves as the \"reference\"
    (fixed) and which is the \"target\" (moved) for that specific
    registration.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Define Visual Cues**: Decide on visual cues for
        reference/target scans. This could be:

        - Icons (e.g., a \"reference\" icon, a \"target\" icon).

        - Text suffixes (e.g., \"ScanA (Ref)\", \"ScanB (Tgt)\").

        - Different text colors.

    2.  **Update ProjectTreeModel::data()**: In
        src/ui/src/projecttreemodel.cpp, modify the data() method to
        provide the chosen visual cues when Qt::DisplayRole or
        Qt::DecorationRole is requested for a scan that is part of a
        RegistrationResult.

    3.  **Data for Cues**: The ProjectTreeModel will need access to the
        sourceScanId and targetScanId stored in the RegistrationResult
        to apply these cues correctly.

  - **References between Files**:

    - ProjectTreeModel.h / ProjectTreeModel.cpp: data() method (modified
      to apply cues), Qt::DecorationRole (for icons).

    - RegistrationProject.h / RegistrationProject.cpp:
      RegistrationResult struct (contains sourceScanId, targetScanId).

    - SidebarWidget.h / SidebarWidget.cpp: Displays the
      ProjectTreeModel.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - Within an aligned scan group in the project tree, the reference
      scan is visually distinct from the target scan (e.g., different
      icon, text suffix).

    - The visual distinction correctly identifies the source and target
      roles as defined in the RegistrationResult.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: ProjectTreeModel::data() returns correct cues.

      - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject with a
        RegistrationResult (A is source, B is target). Call
        ProjectTreeModel::data() for items representing A and B.

      - **Expected Result**: data() returns a specific icon or text
        suffix for Scan A (as source) and Scan B (as target).

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_projecttreemodel.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Reference/Target Identification.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded scans.

      - **Expected Result**: User performs manual alignment, accepting
        it. Observe the updated SidebarWidget\'s tree, where the
        reference scan and target scan within the group are visually
        distinguished.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want the project tree to show alignment
  errors for registered groups.

  - **Description**: Displaying the RMS error directly on the aligned
    group node provides immediate feedback on the quality of a specific
    registration without needing to open a separate report.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Update Group Node Text**: In
        ProjectTreeModel::refreshFromDatabase(), when creating or
        updating a group node, include the rmsError from the
        RegistrationResult in its display text (e.g., \"Aligned Pair:
        ScanA - ScanB (RMS: 5.2mm)\").

    2.  **Tooltip for Details**: Optionally, set the Qt::ToolTipRole for
        the group node to provide more detailed statistics from
        RegistrationResult (e.g., mean error, max error, confidence).

  - **References between Files**:

    - ProjectTreeModel.h / ProjectTreeModel.cpp: refreshFromDatabase()
      (modified to include RMS in group node text), data() (modified to
      return RMS for display role, and detailed stats for tooltip role).

    - RegistrationProject.h / RegistrationProject.cpp:
      RegistrationResult struct (contains rmsError).

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - Each aligned scan group in the project tree displays the RMS error
      of its corresponding registration directly in its label.

    - (Optional) Hovering over the group node displays a tooltip with
      more detailed error statistics.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: ProjectTreeModel displays RMS error.

      - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject with a
        RegistrationResult containing a known rmsError.

      - **Expected Result**: ProjectTreeModel::data() for the group node
        returns a string containing the correct RMS error.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_projecttreemodel.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End RMS Display.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded scans.

      - **Expected Result**: User performs manual alignment, accepts it.
        Observe the updated SidebarWidget\'s tree, where the aligned
        group node displays the calculated RMS error.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

## Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)

1.  **Frontend (UI Components)**:

    - **ProjectTreeModel (src/ui/include/ui/projecttreemodel.h and
      src/ui/src/projecttreemodel.cpp)**:

      - **Modification to refreshFromDatabase()**:

        - Inside this method, after retrieving ScanInfos and
          ClusterInfos, iterate through
          RegistrationProject::getRegistrationResults().

        - For each RegistrationResult, create a new parent QStandardItem
          (or find an existing one) representing the aligned group.

        - Set the display text for this group node to include
          source/target scan names and the rmsError (e.g., \"Aligned:
          \[Source\] - \[Target\] (RMS: X.XXmm)\").

        - Add the QStandardItems for the sourceScanId and targetScanId
          as children of this group node.

        - If using icons, set Qt::DecorationRole data for these child
          scan items based on whether they are source/target (e.g.,
          \'Ref\' or \'Tgt\' icon).

        - If a scan is involved in multiple registrations, decide on the
          primary grouping for display (e.g., first one found, or a more
          complex logic, for MVP keep it simple).

      - **Modification to data()**:

        - For Qt::DisplayRole, return the formatted text for group nodes
          (including RMS).

        - For Qt::DecorationRole, return appropriate QIcons for
          reference/target scans.

        - For Qt::ToolTipRole, return a more detailed string about the
          RegistrationResult including all ErrorStatistics fields.

    - **SidebarWidget (src/ui/src/sidebarwidget.cpp)**:

      - Ensure refreshFromDatabase() is called when
        RegistrationProject::registrationResultAdded signal is caught by
        MainPresenter.

2.  **Backend (Core Logic/Services)**:

    - **RegistrationProject
      (src/registration/include/registration/RegistrationProject.h and
      src/registration/src/RegistrationProject.cpp)**:

      - Ensure QList\<RegistrationResult\> getRegistrationResults()
        const; correctly retrieves all stored registration results.

      - Ensure void registrationResultAdded(const QString& sourceScanId,
        const QString& targetScanId); signal is emitted when a new
        result is added.

    - **MainPresenter (src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp)**:

      - Connect to RegistrationProject::registrationResultAdded signal.

      - In the connected slot, call
        m_view-\>getSidebar()-\>refreshFromDatabase(); to trigger the UI
        update.

## References between Files (Consolidated)

- ProjectTreeModel \<-\> RegistrationProject: Retrieves ScanInfo,
  ClusterInfo, and RegistrationResult to build the tree.

- ProjectTreeModel \<-\> SidebarWidget: Model-view relationship for
  displaying the tree.

- RegistrationProject -\> MainPresenter: Notifies MainPresenter when new
  registrations occur.

- MainPresenter -\> SidebarWidget: Triggers refresh of the tree view.

- ErrorAnalysis::ErrorStatistics: Provides rmsError and other metrics
  for display.

## List of Files being Created

- No new files are created in this sub-sprint. All changes occur in
  existing files.

## Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated)

- The SidebarWidget\'s project tree displays registered scans grouped
  under a common parent node (e.g., \"Aligned: ScanA - ScanB\") or with
  a clear visual indicator of their alignment status.

- The display text for these group nodes includes the RMS error of the
  alignment (e.g., \"RMS: 5.2mm\").

- The project tree distinguishes between reference and target scans
  within a group, either through icons or text suffixes.

- The project tree view updates automatically when a new registration is
  accepted.

- (Optional) Hovering over an aligned group node displays a tooltip with
  a detailed summary of the RegistrationResult.

## Testing Plan (Consolidated)

- **Unit Test**: test_projecttreemodel.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: Basic grouping for a single registered pair.

    - **Test Data**: Create mock SQLiteManager and RegistrationProject
      that return two ScanInfos (A, B) and one RegistrationResult (A to
      B, with a known RMS). Call refreshFromDatabase().

    - **Expected Result**: rowCount() returns 1 (for the group node).
      The group node\'s data(Qt::DisplayRole) returns \"Aligned: ScanA -
      ScanB (RMS: X.XXmm)\". Children are ScanA and ScanB.
      data(Qt::DecorationRole) for A and B returns correct
      reference/target icons.

  - **Test Case 2**: Multiple independent registrations.

    - **Test Data**: Mock SQLiteManager and RegistrationProject
      returning multiple independent RegistrationResults (e.g., A-B,
      C-D).

    - **Expected Result**: Separate group nodes for A-B and C-D are
      created.

  - **Test Case 3**: Mixed aligned and unaligned scans.

    - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject returning A, B, C
      ScanInfos and one RegistrationResult (A-B).

    - **Expected Result**: Tree shows an \"Aligned: A-B\" group, and
      \"ScanC\" as a separate top-level item.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test.

- **Integration Test**: Manual Alignment Workflow - Tree Grouping.

  - **Test Case 1**: End-to-End verification of tree grouping after
    alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Launch application. Load two misaligned scans
      (e.g., scan_A, scan_B).

    - **Expected Result**:

      1.  User performs manual alignment between scan_A and scan_B, then
          clicks \"Accept\".

      2.  Observe the SidebarWidget\'s project tree update immediately.

      3.  A new group node (e.g., \"Aligned: ScanA - ScanB (RMS:
          X.XXmm)\") appears, with scan_A and scan_B as its children.

      4.  Visual cues for reference and target scans are displayed
          correctly on the child nodes.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 3.1 Completion**: It is assumed that Sub-Sprint 3.1
  (Finalization) is fully implemented, meaning
  RegistrationProject::addRegistrationResult() is correctly storing
  results and RegistrationProject::setScanTransform() is updating
  ScanInfo::transform.

- **SQLiteManager Data Access**: SQLiteManager is capable of reliably
  storing and retrieving RegistrationResult objects (if not already
  handled in S3.1, this might require SQLiteManager schema updates and
  persistence logic).

- **Tree View Basic Functionality**: The SidebarWidget (QTreeView) and
  ProjectTreeModel can already display a basic hierarchical list of
  scans and clusters.

- **Consistent Scan IDs**: Scan IDs used in RegistrationResult match the
  IDs used in ScanInfo and ProjectTreeModel for accurate mapping.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: The grouping and visual cues must significantly improve
  the user\'s understanding of complex multi-scan projects.

- **Performance**: Updating the tree view after a registration should be
  instantaneous, even with a moderate number of scans.

- **Consistency**: The visual representation of alignment relationships
  should be consistent across different alignments and project states.

- **Scalability**: The grouping mechanism should scale reasonably for
  projects with many scans and multiple alignment results without
  causing excessive UI lag.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 3.3 enhances the project\'s usability by providing a more
intuitive and informative visualization of aligned scan data. By clearly
grouping registered scans and displaying key quality metrics within the
project tree, it improves the user\'s ability to manage and understand
the overall project structure.
