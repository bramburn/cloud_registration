# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 3, Sub-Sprint 3.2 - Export Functionality Integration

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 3.2: Export
Functionality Integration. This sub-sprint focuses on enabling users to
save their processed and registered point cloud data into various
standard file formats. It integrates the pre-existing PointCloudExporter
and ExportDialog components into the main application workflow.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, I want to save the currently loaded and
  registered point cloud to a file in a chosen format.

  - **Description**: This user story enables users to persistently store
    the results of their point cloud registration work. It includes
    launching an export dialog to select the output format and configure
    relevant options.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Enable \"Export Point Cloud\" Action**: In
        src/app/src/mainwindow.cpp, ensure the m_exportPointCloudAction
        in the \"File\" menu is enabled when a project is open, and the
        IPointCloudViewer reports having data (hasPointCloudData()) and
        potentially, if a registration has been accepted (this implies
        checking RegistrationProject::getRegistrationResults() for
        non-empty list).

    2.  **Connect Menu Action**: Connect the triggered signal of
        m_exportPointCloudAction to a public slot
        MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud().

    3.  **Implement MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud()**:

        - In src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp, implement this slot.

        - **Pre-check**: First, verify that
          m_viewer-\>hasPointCloudData(). If not, display an error
          message using IMainView::displayErrorMessage().

        - **Retrieve Data**: Call m_viewer-\>getCurrentPointCloudData()
          to get the std::vector\<Point\> representing the current point
          cloud data (which should already include any applied
          transformations from accepted registrations).

        - **Instantiate ExportDialog**: Create an instance of
          ExportDialog (src/ui/src/ExportDialog.cpp).

        - **Configure ExportDialog**:

          - Call dialog.setPointCloudData() with the retrieved points.

          - Call dialog.setProjectInfo() (e.g., using
            RegistrationProject::projectName() and description()).

          - Call
            dialog.setAvailableFormats(PointCloudExporter::getSupportedFormats()).

          - (Optional for later sprints: dialog.setAvailableCRS() if CRS
            management is enabled).

        - **Connect Export Signal**: Connect
          ExportDialog::exportRequested(const ExportOptions&) signal to
          PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync(const
          std::vector\<Point\>&, const ExportOptions&).

        - **Show Dialog**: Call dialog.exec() to display the dialog
          modally. If the dialog returns QDialog::Accepted, then proceed
          with the export.

    4.  **Implement IPointCloudViewer::getCurrentPointCloudData()**:

        - In src/rendering/src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp, ensure
          getCurrentPointCloudData() reliably extracts all points (XYZ,
          Color, Intensity) from the viewer\'s current state.

        - Crucially, for points that are part of a *permanently*
          transformed scan (i.e., transformation applied in Sub-Sprint
          3.1 and stored in RegistrationProject), these points should be
          returned in their transformed world coordinates. The viewer\'s
          internal data representation (e.g., m_pointData or
          m_vertexData) needs to reflect the current ScanInfo::transform
          values for scans.

    5.  **Handle Export Completion**: In MainPresenter, listen to
        PointCloudExporter::exportCompleted signal. When received, call
        IMainView::displayInfoMessage() or
        IMainView::displayErrorMessage() to inform the user about the
        export result.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainWindow.h / MainWindow.cpp: m_exportPointCloudAction
      (enabled/disabled logic, connects to MainPresenter).

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Adds handleExportPointCloud()
      slot. Calls IPointCloudViewer::getCurrentPointCloudData(),
      ExportDialog (creation, configuration, exec()), connects to
      PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync(). Listens to
      PointCloudExporter::exportCompleted.

    - IPointCloudViewer.h / IPointCloudViewer.cpp
      (PointCloudViewerWidget implements this):
      getCurrentPointCloudData() method (returns std::vector\<Point\>).

    - ExportDialog.h / ExportDialog.cpp: setPointCloudData(),
      setProjectInfo(), setAvailableFormats(), getExportOptions(),
      exportRequested signal.

    - PointCloudExporter.h / PointCloudExporter.cpp:
      exportPointCloudAsync(), exportCompleted signal.

    - export/IFormatWriter.h: Defines the Point struct (used for data
      transfer from viewer to exporter).

    - RegistrationProject.h / RegistrationProject.cpp: projectName(),
      description(), and methods to query registered scans.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - The \"Export Point Cloud\" menu item is enabled when a project is
      open, point cloud data is loaded, and at least one scan is in a
      registered state.

    - Clicking \"Export Point Cloud\" successfully launches the
      ExportDialog.

    - The ExportDialog receives and displays the current point cloud
      data details (e.g., total point count).

    - The ExportDialog correctly lists available export formats (E57,
      LAS, PLY, XYZ).

    - The ExportDialog\'s \"Export\" button (when clicked and accepted)
      triggers PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync() with the
      correct Point data (including transformations) and ExportOptions.

    - A success or failure message is displayed to the user after the
      export operation completes.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Export Action Enablement.

      - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject with/without accepted
        RegistrationResults, mock IPointCloudViewer with/without loaded
        data.

      - **Expected Result**: m_exportPointCloudAction is enabled only
        when prerequisites are met (project open, viewer has data, and a
        registration exists).

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: Export Dialog Launch & Data Passing.

      - **Test Data**: Mock IPointCloudViewer to return a
        std::vector\<Point\> containing test data. Mock ExportDialog.

      - **Expected Result**: handleExportPointCloud() calls
        m_viewer-\>getCurrentPointCloudData() and then
        ExportDialog::setPointCloudData() with the correct data.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 3**: IPointCloudViewer::getCurrentPointCloudData()
      Correctness.

      - **Test Data**: A loaded point cloud in PointCloudViewerWidget.
        Programmatically apply a known transformation to one of the
        internal scans (simulating an accepted registration).

      - **Expected Result**: getCurrentPointCloudData() returns points
        in their *transformed* world coordinates for the transformed
        scan, and original coordinates for untransformed scans.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp)

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to see a progress indicator during
  the export process.

  - **Description**: Long-running export operations should provide
    visual feedback to the user, indicating that the application is busy
    and how much progress has been made.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Display Progress Dialog/Bar**:

        - In MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud(), before calling
          PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync(), use
          IMainView::showProgressDialog(true, \"Exporting Point Cloud\",
          \"Initializing\...\").

        - Connect PointCloudExporter::progressUpdated(int percentage,
          const QString& stage) signal to IMainView::updateProgress(int
          percentage, const QString& stage).

    2.  **Hide Progress Dialog on Completion**: In MainPresenter\'s slot
        that handles PointCloudExporter::exportCompleted, call
        IMainView::showProgressDialog(false) to hide the progress
        dialog.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Calls
      IMainView::showProgressDialog() and IMainView::updateProgress().
      Listens to PointCloudExporter::progressUpdated and
      exportCompleted.

    - IMainView.h / IMainView.cpp (MainWindow implements this):
      showProgressDialog(bool, QString, QString), updateProgress(int,
      QString).

    - PointCloudExporter.h / PointCloudExporter.cpp: progressUpdated
      signal.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - When an export is initiated, a progress dialog appears.

    - The progress dialog updates its percentage and status message as
      the export proceeds.

    - The progress dialog disappears automatically upon export
      completion (success or failure).

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: Progress Dialog Display.

      - **Test Data**: Mock PointCloudExporter to emit progressUpdated
        signals with various percentages and stages over a short period.

      - **Expected Result**: IMainView::showProgressDialog(true) is
        called at the start, IMainView::updateProgress() is called
        multiple times, and IMainView::showProgressDialog(false) is
        called at the end.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp)

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Export with Progress.

      - **Test Data**: Application with loaded and aligned scans.

      - **Expected Result**: User initiates export. A progress dialog
        appears, showing progress percentage and stage updates. The
        dialog closes when the export is done.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

## Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)

1.  **Frontend (UI Components)**:

    - **MainWindow (src/app/src/mainwindow.cpp)**:

      - Ensure m_exportPointCloudAction in the \"File\" menu is
        correctly linked to MainPresenter::handleExportPointCloud().

      - Implement logic to enable/disable m_exportPointCloudAction: It
        should be enabled if m_currentProject is not null,
        m_viewer-\>hasPointCloudData() is true, and potentially
        m_currentProject-\>getRegistrationResults().size() \> 0
        (indicating at least one accepted registration).

    - **MainPresenter (src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp)**:

      - Add handleExportPointCloud() public slot.

      - **Pre-check**: Call m_viewer-\>hasPointCloudData(). If false,
        call m_view-\>displayErrorMessage(\"Export Error\", \"No point
        cloud data loaded for export.\"); return;.

      - **Get Data**: std::vector\<Point\> dataToExport =
        m_viewer-\>getCurrentPointCloudData();

      - **Handle Empty Data**: If dataToExport.empty(), display an error
        and return.

      - **Create Dialog**: ExportDialog
        dialog(static_cast\<QWidget\*\>(m_view)); (Cast IMainView to
        QWidget\* if ExportDialog requires QWidget\* parent).

      - **Configure Dialog**:

        - dialog.setPointCloudData(dataToExport);

        - dialog.setProjectInfo(m_currentProject-\>projectName(),
          m_currentProject-\>description()); (Assuming m_currentProject
          is accessible and valid).

        - dialog.setAvailableFormats(PointCloudExporter::getSupportedFormats());

      - **Connect Dialog & Exporter**:

        - connect(&dialog, &ExportDialog::exportRequested,
          m_exporter.get(), &PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync);

        - connect(m_exporter.get(),
          &PointCloudExporter::progressUpdated, m_view,
          &IMainView::updateProgress);

        - connect(m_exporter.get(),
          &PointCloudExporter::exportCompleted, this,
          &MainPresenter::onExportCompleted); (New slot for
          MainPresenter to handle results and hide progress).

      - **Show Dialog**: if (dialog.exec() == QDialog::Accepted) {
        m_view-\>showProgressDialog(true, \"Exporting Point Cloud\",
        \"Starting export\...\"); }

    - **IPointCloudViewer
      (src/rendering/src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp)**:

      - Implement std::vector\<Point\> getCurrentPointCloudData() const
        override;.

      - This method needs to iterate through all points currently loaded
        and rendered in the viewer.

      - **Crucially**: For each point, if it belongs to a scan that has
        a *permanent* transformation applied (i.e., ScanInfo::transform
        in RegistrationProject), the point\'s coordinates must be
        returned in its transformed position relative to the global
        origin.

        - This implies PointCloudViewerWidget might need access to
          RegistrationProject or receive scan transformation updates. A
          simpler approach for MVP is for PointCloudViewerWidget to
          return points from its m_pointData (which is already
          transformed if coming from accepted manual alignment),
          ensuring all attributes (color, intensity) are also
          transferred to the Point struct.

        - The PointFullData in octree.h has optional color/intensity.
          Point in IFormatWriter.h has direct uint8_t r,g,b and float
          intensity. Conversion logic is needed.

    - **ExportDialog (src/ui/src/ExportDialog.cpp)**:

      - Ensure its setPointCloudData() and other set\* methods properly
        store the input std::vector\<Point\>.

      - Ensure its internal \"Export\" button emits exportRequested with
        the ExportOptions obtained from UI.

      - The dialog needs to correctly react to IMainView::updateProgress
        calls from MainPresenter by updating its own progress bar and
        labels.

2.  **Backend (Core Logic/Services)**:

    - **PointCloudExporter (src/export/PointCloudExporter.cpp)**:

      - Ensure exportPointCloudAsync(const std::vector\<Point\>& points,
        const ExportOptions& options) is prepared to accept
        std::vector\<Point\> as input for the points to export. Its
        internal ExportWorker also needs this.

    - **MainPresenter (src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp)**:

      - Add a new private slot void onExportCompleted(const
        ExportResult& result);

      - In onExportCompleted():

        - Call m_view-\>showProgressDialog(false);

        - Display IMainView::displayInfoMessage(\"Export Successful\",
          \...) or IMainView::displayErrorMessage(\"Export Failed\",
          \...) based on result.success.

    - **RegistrationProject**:

      - Ensure projectName() and description() methods are available and
        return relevant project metadata.

      - Ensure getRegistrationResults() is available to determine if any
        scans are registered.

## References between Files (Consolidated)

  progress/completion.

- MainPresenter \<-\> IMainView (MainWindow): Displays
  progress/messages.

- IPointCloudViewer (PointCloudViewerWidget) -\> Point (from
  IFormatWriter.h): Provides data for export.

## List of Files being Created

- No new files are created in this sub-sprint. All changes occur in
  existing files.

## Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated)

- The \"Export Point Cloud\" menu item is enabled when a project is
  open, the viewer has data, and at least one registration is accepted.

- Clicking this menu item launches the ExportDialog.

- The ExportDialog is pre-populated with current point cloud information
  (e.g., total points) and project name/description.

- The ExportDialog lists E57, LAS, PLY, and XYZ as available export
  formats.

- Upon ExportDialog acceptance,
  PointCloudExporter::exportPointCloudAsync() is invoked with the
  current std::vector\<Point\> data and chosen ExportOptions.

- The std::vector\<Point\> passed to the exporter contains points with
  their *currently applied permanent transformations* (from
  RegistrationProject).

- During export, a progress dialog (or status bar update) shows
  percentage and stage updates.

- Upon completion (success or failure), the progress dialog closes, and
  a clear message is displayed to the user.

## Testing Plan (Consolidated)

- **Unit Test**: test_mainpresenter.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: Export action enablement logic.

    - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject with/without
      RegistrationResult, mock IPointCloudViewer with/without data.

    - **Expected Result**: m_exportPointCloudAction in MainWindow\'s
      menu is enabled only when all preconditions (project open, viewer
      has data, registration exists) are met.

  - **Test Case 2**: Export dialog launch and data passing.

    - **Test Data**: Mock IPointCloudViewer to return a sample
      std::vector\<Point\>. Mock ExportDialog to verify
      setPointCloudData and setProjectInfo calls. Mock
      PointCloudExporter to verify exportPointCloudAsync is called.

    - **Expected Result**: handleExportPointCloud() calls the expected
      methods on mocks with correct data.

  - **Test Case 3**: Progress display integration.

    - **Test Data**: Mock PointCloudExporter to emit progressUpdated
      signals. Mock IMainView.

    - **Expected Result**: IMainView::updateProgress() is called with
      the correct percentage and stage values.
      IMainView::showProgressDialog() is called at start and end.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Mock / Qt Test.

- **Unit Test**: test_pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: getCurrentPointCloudData() returns transformed
    data.

    - **Test Data**: Load a point cloud into PointCloudViewerWidget.
      Programmatically apply a permanent transformation to one of the
      internal scans (e.g., using a test helper method that modifies
      m_pointData directly as if RegistrationProject had updated it).

    - **Expected Result**: getCurrentPointCloudData() returns a
      std::vector\<Point\> where the points of the transformed scan have
      their coordinates adjusted by the applied transformation.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test.

- **Integration Test**: Manual Alignment Workflow - Export Phase.

  - **Test Case 1**: Full export workflow after manual alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Launch application. Load two misaligned scans.
      Perform a successful manual alignment (Sub-Sprint 3.1 completed).

    - **Expected Result**:

      1.  The \"Export Point Cloud\" menu item is enabled.

      2.  User clicks \"Export Point Cloud\". The ExportDialog appears.

      3.  User selects \"LAS\" format, provides a filename, and clicks
          \"Export\".

      4.  A progress dialog/bar appears, showing percentage and stage
          updates.

      5.  Upon completion, a success message is displayed.

      6.  Verify the exported LAS file exists and can be opened by an
          external viewer (e.g., CloudCompare) and contains the correct
          number of points in their *transformed* positions.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script, external
      viewer for validation.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 3.1 Completion**: The \"Accept\" action for manual
  alignment is fully implemented, meaning
  RegistrationProject::setScanTransform() correctly updates the
  permanent transformation of scans.

- **PointCloudExporter Functionality**: The PointCloudExporter and its
  underlying IFormatWriter implementations (E57, LAS, PLY, XYZ) are
  fully functional, as developed in Sprint 6 (analyse the previous
  response and produce an MCP.(1).md). This includes asynchronous
  export, progress reporting, and handling of std::vector\<Point\>
  input.

- **IMainView Progress Display**: The IMainView::showProgressDialog()
  and updateProgress() methods are available and work as expected.

- **RegistrationProject State**: RegistrationProject reliably tracks
  whether a scan is registered and provides its name/description.

- **Point Data Consistency**: PointCloudViewerWidget can consistently
  return the *full* point cloud data with *applied transformations* in
  the std::vector\<Point\> format required by the exporter. This may
  require PointCloudViewerWidget to internally manage the
  transformations applied by RegistrationProject.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Export operations, especially for large datasets,
  should be performed asynchronously and not block the UI. Overall
  export time should be reasonable (e.g., under 1 minute for 10 million
  points, depending on format and hardware).

- **Data Integrity**: Exported files must be valid and contain the exact
  point data (including transformed coordinates and attributes) as
  displayed in the viewer.

- **Usability**: The export dialog is clear and easy to use. Progress
  feedback is timely and informative.

- **Robustness**: The system should handle potential errors during
  export (e.g., disk full, invalid path) gracefully and report them to
  the user.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 3.2 is crucial for delivering a tangible output from the
registration process. By integrating robust export functionality with
clear progress feedback, it provides users with the ability to leverage
their aligned point clouds externally, marking a significant milestone
towards the MVP.
