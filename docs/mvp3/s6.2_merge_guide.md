# Sprint 6.2 Merge Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for merging the Sprint 6.2 implementation into the `feature/modular-restructure` branch and creating a Pull Request.

## Prerequisites
- All Sprint 6.2 changes have been implemented and tested
- Working directory is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- You have access to the repository with appropriate permissions

## Step-by-Step Merge Process

### 1. Verify Current Branch Status
```powershell
# Check current branch and status
git status
git branch

# Ensure you're on the correct working branch
# If not, switch to your working branch
git checkout <your-working-branch>
```

### 2. Stage and Commit Changes
```powershell
# Add all modified files
git add src/quality/include/quality/QualityAssessment.h
git add src/quality/include/quality/PDFReportGenerator.h
git add src/quality/src/PDFReportGenerator.cpp
git add src/app/include/app/MainPresenter.h
git add src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp
git add src/app/src/mainwindow.cpp
git add tests/test_sprint6_2.cpp
git add docs/mvp3/s6.2_implementation_summary.md
git add docs/mvp3/s6.2_merge_guide.md

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Implement Sprint 6.2: PDF Report Generation UI & Backend Hookup

- Add QualityReport::isValid() method for validation
- Update PDFReportGenerator with new signature and signal emission
- Implement MainPresenter report generation handling
- Add quality assessment integration with report generation
- Delegate MainWindow report generation to MainPresenter
- Add comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
- Update documentation with implementation details

Resolves Sprint 6.2 requirements as specified in docs/mvp3/s6.2.md"
```

### 3. Switch to feature/modular-restructure Branch
```powershell
# Fetch latest changes from remote
git fetch origin

# Switch to the target branch
git checkout feature/modular-restructure

# Pull latest changes to ensure you're up to date
git pull origin feature/modular-restructure
```

### 4. Merge Your Changes
```powershell
# Merge your working branch into feature/modular-restructure
git merge <your-working-branch>

# If there are merge conflicts, resolve them:
# 1. Open conflicted files in your editor
# 2. Resolve conflicts by choosing appropriate changes
# 3. Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<< ======= >>>>>>>)
# 4. Stage resolved files: git add <resolved-file>
# 5. Complete the merge: git commit
```

### 5. Test the Merged Changes
```powershell
# Build the project to ensure no compilation errors
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Debug

# Run tests if available
ctest --output-on-failure

# Return to project root
cd ..
```

### 6. Push to Remote Repository
```powershell
# Push the updated feature/modular-restructure branch
git push origin feature/modular-restructure
```

## Creating a Pull Request

### 1. Navigate to Repository
- Go to your GitHub repository in a web browser
- Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab

### 2. Create New Pull Request
- Click "New pull request"
- Set base branch: `main` (or your default branch)
- Set compare branch: `feature/modular-restructure`

### 3. Fill Pull Request Details

**Title:**
```

### 4. Add Reviewers and Labels
- Add appropriate reviewers
- Add labels: `enhancement`, `sprint-6.2`, `pdf-generation`
- Set milestone if applicable

### 5. Submit Pull Request
- Click "Create pull request"

## Post-PR Actions

### 1. Monitor CI/CD Pipeline
- Check that all automated tests pass
- Address any build failures or test failures

### 2. Address Review Comments
- Respond to reviewer feedback
- Make necessary changes if requested
- Push additional commits to the same branch

### 3. Merge Process
Once approved:
```powershell
# If using squash and merge (recommended):
# - GitHub will handle the merge
# - Delete the feature branch after merge

# If merging locally:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/modular-restructure
git push origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### Merge Conflicts
If you encounter merge conflicts:
1. Identify conflicted files: `git status`
2. Open each file and resolve conflicts manually
3. Look for conflict markers: `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
4. Choose the correct version or combine changes
5. Remove conflict markers
6. Stage resolved files: `git add <file>`
7. Complete merge: `git commit`

### Build Failures
If the build fails after merge:
1. Check for missing includes or dependencies
2. Verify CMakeLists.txt files are correct
3. Ensure all required libraries are linked
4. Check for syntax errors or typos

### Test Failures
If tests fail:
1. Run tests individually to isolate issues
2. Check test data and expectations
3. Verify mock objects are properly configured
4. Update tests if implementation changed

## Rollback Plan
If issues are discovered after merge:
```powershell
# Create a revert commit
git revert <commit-hash>

# Or reset to previous state (use with caution)
git reset --hard <previous-commit-hash>
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/modular-restructure
```

## Contact
For questions or issues with the merge process, contact the development team or create an issue in the repository.
