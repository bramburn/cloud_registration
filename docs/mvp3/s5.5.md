# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 5, Sub-Sprint 5.5 - Finalization & Workflow Integration

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 5.5:
Finalization & Workflow Integration. This sub-sprint completes the
target-based alignment workflow, enabling users to explicitly commit or
discard the computed transformation. It ensures a consistent user
experience with manual and ICP alignments, and integrates this
finalization into the main RegistrationWorkflowWidget flow.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, after a target-based alignment, I want to
  explicitly accept the result to apply it permanently to the scans.

  - **Description**: Once the target-based alignment has been computed
    and previewed, the user needs to confirm that the transformation
    should be applied permanently to the project data. This involves
    updating the scan\'s pose and recording the registration.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Re-purpose \"Accept\" Button**: In
        src/ui/src/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp, ensure the \"Accept\"
        button (m_acceptButton) is displayed and becomes enabled when a
        valid target-based alignment result is available (i.e.,
        AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().state ==
        AlignmentEngine::AlignmentState::Valid and algorithm ==
        \"TargetBased\").

    2.  **Connect \"Accept\" Button (if not already)**: Ensure
        m_acceptButton\'s clicked signal is connected to
        MainPresenter::handleAcceptAlignment() (this slot is already
        used for manual alignment, and it will be made generic to handle
        all alignment types).

    3.  **Enhance MainPresenter::handleAcceptAlignment()**:

        - Retrieve the final TransformationMatrix from
          AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().transformation and the
          ErrorStatistics from
          AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().errorStats.

        - Retrieve the algorithm string (e.g., \"Manual\", \"ICP\",
          \"TargetBased\") from
          AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().algorithm.

        - Identify the sourceScanId and targetScanId of the scans
          involved (these should be accessible from MainPresenter\'s
          internal state for the current alignment session).

        - Call RegistrationProject::setScanTransform(targetScanId,
          finalTransformation).

        - Create a RegistrationProject::RegistrationResult object,
          populating all fields including algorithm and
          correspondenceCount (from errorStats.numCorrespondences).

        - Call RegistrationProject::addRegistrationResult(result).

        - Call AlignmentEngine::clearTargetsAndCorrespondences() (new
          method) to reset target-based session state.

        - Call PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform() to remove
          the preview.

        - Update status bar message with success confirmation.

        - Instruct RegistrationWorkflowWidget to transition to
          RegistrationStep::QualityReview.

  - **References between Files**:

    - AlignmentControlPanel.h / AlignmentControlPanel.cpp: Manages
      \"Accept\" button state.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: handleAcceptAlignment() slot.
      Calls AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult(),
      RegistrationProject::setScanTransform(),
      RegistrationProject::addRegistrationResult(),
      AlignmentEngine::clearTargetsAndCorrespondences(),
      PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform(),
      RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp: getCurrentResult(),
      clearTargetsAndCorrespondences() (new).

    - RegistrationProject.h / RegistrationProject.cpp:
      setScanTransform(), addRegistrationResult(). RegistrationResult
      struct.

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.h / PointCloudViewerWidget.cpp:
      clearDynamicTransform().

    - RegistrationWorkflowWidget.h / RegistrationWorkflowWidget.cpp:
      Manages workflow step transitions.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - The \"Accept\" button in AlignmentControlPanel is enabled when a
      valid target-based alignment is computed.

    - Clicking \"Accept\" permanently updates the target scan\'s
      transformation in RegistrationProject.

    - A RegistrationProject::RegistrationResult entry is created and
      stored, correctly indicating \"TargetBased\" as the algorithm.

    - The dynamic preview is removed from the 3D viewer.

    - The AlignmentEngine\'s target-based session state is reset.

    - The UI transitions to RegistrationStep::QualityReview.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: \"Accept\" button enablement after target-based
      alignment.

      - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine to return a Valid
        AlignmentResult with algorithm=\"TargetBased\".

      - **Expected Result**: \"Accept\" button is enabled.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_alignmentcontrolpanel.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: MainPresenter::handleAcceptAlignment() for
      target-based.

      - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine (returns valid target-based
        result), mock RegistrationProject, PointCloudViewerWidget,
        RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter calls setScanTransform(),
        addRegistrationResult() with algorithm=\"TargetBased\",
        clearTargetsAndCorrespondences(), clearDynamicTransform(), and
        triggers QualityReview transition.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 3**: RegistrationProject stores target-based result.

      - **Test Data**: Create RegistrationProject instance. Call
        setScanTransform() and addRegistrationResult() with target-based
        data.

      - **Expected Result**: getRegistrationResults() returns the result
        with algorithm=\"TargetBased\".

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_registrationproject.cpp).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to discard the target-based
  alignment if I\'m not satisfied.

  - **Description**: If the target-based alignment is not satisfactory,
    the user should be able to abandon it without applying any permanent
    changes, returning to the state before the alignment was computed.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Re-purpose \"Cancel\" Button**: Ensure the \"Cancel\" button
        (m_cancelButton) in AlignmentControlPanel is available when a
        target-based alignment result is previewed.

    2.  **Connect \"Cancel\" Button (if not already)**: Ensure
        m_cancelButton\'s clicked signal is connected to
        MainPresenter::handleCancelAlignment() (already used for manual
        alignment, made generic).

    3.  **Enhance MainPresenter::handleCancelAlignment()**:

        - Call AlignmentEngine::clearTargetsAndCorrespondences() to
          reset the target-based session.

        - Call PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform() to remove
          the preview.

        - Update status bar message confirming cancellation.

        - Instruct RegistrationWorkflowWidget to transition back to the
          RegistrationStep::TargetDetection step.

  - **References between Files**:

    - AlignmentControlPanel.h / AlignmentControlPanel.cpp: \"Cancel\"
      button.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: handleCancelAlignment() slot.
      Calls AlignmentEngine::clearTargetsAndCorrespondences(),
      PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform(),
      RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp:
      clearTargetsAndCorrespondences() (new).

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.h / PointCloudViewerWidget.cpp:
      clearDynamicTransform().

    - RegistrationWorkflowWidget.h / RegistrationWorkflowWidget.cpp:
      Manages workflow step transitions.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - The \"Cancel\" button is available in AlignmentControlPanel when a
      target-based alignment is previewed.

    - Clicking \"Cancel\" clears the dynamic alignment preview from the
      3D viewer.

    - The AlignmentEngine\'s target-based session state is reset.

    - No permanent changes are made to RegistrationProject data.

    - The UI transitions back to the RegistrationStep::TargetDetection
      step.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: MainPresenter::handleCancelAlignment() for
      target-based.

      - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine, PointCloudViewerWidget,
        RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter calls
        AlignmentEngine::clearTargetsAndCorrespondences() and
        PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform(), and transitions
        RegistrationWorkflowWidget to TargetDetection.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Discard.

      - **Test Data**: Application with loaded scans, targets detected,
        target-based alignment computed and previewed.

      - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Cancel\". The preview
        disappears. The UI reverts to the TargetDetection step.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

## Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)

1.  **Frontend (UI Components)**:

    - **AlignmentControlPanel (src/ui/src/AlignmentControlPanel.cpp and
      src/ui/include/ui/AlignmentControlPanel.h)**:

      - Ensure m_acceptButton and m_cancelButton are correctly visible
        and enabled when AlignmentEngine::AlignmentState::Valid is
        reached *and* AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().algorithm is
        \"TargetBased\".

      - No new buttons needed, re-use existing finalization buttons.

2.  **Backend (Core Logic/Services)**:

    - **MainPresenter (src/app/include/app/MainPresenter.h and
      src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp)**:

      - **Refactor handleAcceptAlignment()**: Make it generic.

        - It should use AlignmentEngine::getCurrentResult().algorithm to
          populate the RegistrationResult::algorithm field.

        - Instead of AlignmentEngine::clearCorrespondences(), it will
          call a new, more comprehensive reset:
          AlignmentEngine::resetCurrentAlignmentSession().

      - **Refactor handleCancelAlignment()**: Make it generic.

        - It will also call
          AlignmentEngine::resetCurrentAlignmentSession().

        - The next workflow step should be determined based on the
          *current* alignment type (MainPresenter\'s internal state like
          currentWorkflowMode). If currentWorkflowMode is
          TargetDetection, transition to
          RegistrationStep::TargetDetection. If ManualAlignment,
          transition to RegistrationStep::ManualAlignment.

    - **AlignmentEngine (src/registration/AlignmentEngine.h and
      src/registration/src/AlignmentEngine.cpp)**:

      - **New Method**: void resetCurrentAlignmentSession();

        - This method should clear m_currentResult, reset
          m_currentResult.state to Idle, clear all stored
          TargetCorrespondence (for manual alignment), and clear all
          detected Target objects
          (m_targetManager-\>clearAllTargets();). This comprehensive
          reset is vital for a clean slate.

      - **Update clearCorrespondences() and resetICPState()**: These
        methods should now internally call
        resetCurrentAlignmentSession().

      - Modify AlignmentResult struct to include QString algorithm;
        field. This must be set by AlignmentEngine when
        performAlignment() is called for manual, ICP, or target-based.

      - When startTargetBasedAlignment() completes successfully, ensure
        m_currentResult.algorithm = \"TargetBased\"; is set.

    - **RegistrationProject**: Methods setScanTransform() and
      addRegistrationResult() (from S3.1) are already prepared.

    - **PointCloudViewerWidget**: Method clearDynamicTransform() (from
      S2.2) is already prepared.

  correctly enabled/disabled after a target-based alignment computation.

- Clicking \"Accept\" for a target-based alignment:

  - Permanently applies the computed TransformationMatrix to the target
    scan in RegistrationProject.

  - Creates and stores a RegistrationProject::RegistrationResult with
    algorithm set to \"TargetBased\".

  - Clears the dynamic preview from the PointCloudViewerWidget.

  - Resets the AlignmentEngine\'s current alignment session (including
    clearing all detected targets).

  - Transitions the RegistrationWorkflowWidget to
    RegistrationStep::QualityReview.

- Clicking \"Cancel\" for a target-based alignment:

  - Clears the dynamic preview from the PointCloudViewerWidget.

  - Resets the AlignmentEngine\'s current alignment session (including
    clearing all detected targets).

  - Makes no permanent changes to RegistrationProject data.

  - Transitions the RegistrationWorkflowWidget back to
    RegistrationStep::TargetDetection.

- The AlignmentEngine::resetCurrentAlignmentSession() method correctly
  clears all associated data (correspondences, detected targets, current
  result).

## Testing Plan (Consolidated)

- **Unit Test**: test_mainpresenter.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: handleAcceptAlignment() for target-based alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine returning a Valid
      AlignmentResult with algorithm=\"TargetBased\". Mock
      RegistrationProject, PointCloudViewerWidget,
      RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

    - **Expected Result**: Calls to
      RegistrationProject::setScanTransform() and
      addRegistrationResult() with algorithm=\"TargetBased\". Calls to
      AlignmentEngine::resetCurrentAlignmentSession() and
      PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform().
      RegistrationWorkflowWidget transitions to QualityReview.

  - **Test Case 2**: handleCancelAlignment() for target-based alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine, PointCloudViewerWidget,
      RegistrationWorkflowWidget.

    - **Expected Result**: Calls to
      AlignmentEngine::resetCurrentAlignmentSession() and
      PointCloudViewerWidget::clearDynamicTransform().
      RegistrationWorkflowWidget transitions to TargetDetection.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Mock / Qt Test.

- **Unit Test**: test_alignmentengine.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: resetCurrentAlignmentSession() clears all data.

    - **Test Data**: Manually add correspondences and targets to
      AlignmentEngine (via addCorrespondence,
      m_targetManager-\>addTarget). Call resetCurrentAlignmentSession().

    - **Expected Result**: AlignmentEngine\'s internal lists of
      correspondences, detected targets, and m_currentResult are
      empty/reset.

  - **Test Case 2**: AlignmentResult::algorithm is correctly set.

    - **Test Data**: Trigger startTargetBasedAlignment().

    - **Expected Result**: m_currentResult.algorithm is \"TargetBased\".

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test.

- **Integration Test**: Target-Based Alignment Workflow - Finalization.

  - **Test Case 1**: Accept Target-Based Alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, misaligned scans. User
      has detected targets on both and computed a target-based
      alignment, resulting in a valid preview.

    - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Accept\". The preview
      disappears. The target scan is permanently transformed. The
      TargetDetectionDialog\'s results table and internal target data
      are cleared. The UI transitions to \"Quality Review\".

  - **Test Case 2**: Discard Target-Based Alignment.

    - **Test Data**: Same as Test Case 1.

    - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Cancel\". The preview
      disappears. The target scan reverts to its pre-alignment position.
      The TargetDetectionDialog\'s results table and internal target
      data are cleared. The UI remains in the TargetDetection step.

  - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 5.4 Completion**: The target-based alignment computation
  and live preview are fully functional and reliable.

- **Generic handleAcceptAlignment() / handleCancelAlignment()**: These
  MainPresenter slots (from S3.1) are refactored to be generic enough to
  handle results from manual, ICP, and target-based alignments.

- **AlignmentEngine State Management**: AlignmentEngine can accurately
  store the algorithm used for the current alignment result.

- **TargetManager::clearAllTargets()**: A method exists in TargetManager
  to clear all currently stored target data for a clean session reset.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Consistency**: Finalization behavior (Accept/Cancel) is consistent
  across all alignment types (manual, ICP, target-based).

- **Data Integrity**: Accepting target-based alignment results in
  accurate and persistent storage of transformations and registration
  records.

- **Usability**: Clear feedback is provided during finalization, and the
  workflow transitions are intuitive.

- **Robustness**: The session reset (resetCurrentAlignmentSession()) is
  comprehensive and prevents state-related issues for subsequent
  alignment attempts.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 5.5 completes the target-based alignment feature, making it a
fully integrated and usable part of the application. By providing
consistent finalization controls and robust session management, it
ensures a seamless user experience and strengthens the application\'s
overall capabilities.
