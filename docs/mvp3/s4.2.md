# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 4, Sub-Sprint 4.2 - ICP Execution & Live Progress

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 4.2: ICP
Execution & Live Progress. This sub-sprint focuses on executing the
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm in the backend and providing
real-time feedback to the user through a dedicated progress widget and
live updates in the 3D viewer. This is critical for transparency and
user control during automated alignment.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, when ICP is running, I want to see a live
  progress bar indicating the current iteration and overall completion.

  - **Description**: Automated processes like ICP can be time-consuming.
    Users need clear visual feedback that the computation is active,
    progressing, and roughly how much time remains.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Instantiate and Show ICPProgressWidget**: In
        MainPresenter::startAutomaticAlignment() (from Sub-Sprint 4.1),
        instantiate ICPProgressWidget and call show() on it. Pass
        AlignmentEngine (or ICPRegistration directly) and maxIterations
        to ICPProgressWidget::startMonitoring().

    2.  **Connect Progress Signals**:

        - Connect AlignmentEngine::progressUpdated(iteration, rmsError,
          transformation) signal to
          ICPProgressWidget::updateProgress(iteration, rmsError,
          transformation). (Note: AlignmentEngine will relay this from
          ICPRegistration).

    3.  **Implement ICPProgressWidget::updateProgress()**: This slot
        (already defined) in src/ui/src/ICPProgressWidget.cpp needs full
        implementation to:

        - Update the QProgressBar based on iteration and maxIterations.

        - Update a QLabel (m_iterationLabel) to show \"Iteration: X /
          Y\".

        - Update m_errorLabel to display the current rmsError.

        - Update m_timeLabel with elapsed time (via QTimer).

        - Update m_statusLabel with a text status (e.g.,
          \"Converging\...\", \"Computing correspondences\...\").

        - Call QApplication::processEvents() periodically to keep the UI
          responsive during computation (especially if computation is
          synchronous on the UI thread for now, though it should be
          async).

    4.  **Backend Signal Emission**: Ensure ICPRegistration::compute()
        (specifically in src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.cpp) emits
        progressUpdated(iteration, rmsError, currentTransformation) in
        each iteration of its loop.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: startAutomaticAlignment()
      (launches ICPProgressWidget, connects signals).

    - ICPProgressWidget.h / ICPProgressWidget.cpp: New UI setup
      (QProgressBar, QLabels for iteration, error, time),
      startMonitoring(), updateProgress() implementation.

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp: Relays progressUpdated
      from ICPRegistration.

    - ICPRegistration.h / ICPRegistration.cpp: Emits progressUpdated in
      its compute() loop.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - When ICP is initiated, the ICPProgressWidget appears.

    - The ICPProgressWidget\'s progress bar (showing current iteration
      count) and status labels update in real-time as ICP iterates.

    - The displayed RMS error value accurately reflects the current
      error in each iteration.

    - An elapsed time counter is visible and updates.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: ICPProgressWidget updates UI correctly.

      - **Test Data**: Call ICPProgressWidget::updateProgress() with a
        sequence of iteration, rmsError, and transformation values.

      - **Expected Result**: The progress bar, iteration label, error
        label, and time label update as expected for each call.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_icpprogreswidget.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: ICPRegistration emits progress signals.

      - **Test Data**: Mock ICPRegistration dependencies if necessary.
        Call ICPRegistration::compute().

      - **Expected Result**: ICPRegistration emits progressUpdated
        signals during its iteration loop. The iteration, rmsError, and
        transformation parameters in the signal are correct.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_icpregistration.cpp).

    - **Test Case 3**: End-to-End Progress Display.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, misaligned scans.
        User initiates ICP from ICPParameterDialog.

      - **Expected Result**: The ICPProgressWidget pops up and displays
        live updates as ICP runs.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to see the \"moving\" scan
  continuously update its position in the 3D viewer during ICP
  computation.

  - **Description**: This provides a powerful visual aid for users to
    track the convergence of the ICP algorithm and understand its impact
    on the alignment process.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Pass Intermediate Transformation**: The
        ICPRegistration::progressUpdated signal already includes the
        currentTransformation.

    2.  **MainPresenter Relays to Viewer**: In
        MainPresenter::startAutomaticAlignment() (or its connected
        slot), ensure that the currentTransformation received from
        AlignmentEngine::progressUpdated is passed to
        PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform(const QMatrix4x4&
        transform).

    3.  **PointCloudViewerWidget Dynamic Update**:
        PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform() (implemented in
        S2.2) will dynamically apply this matrix to the \"moving\" scan
        for rendering in paintGL().

    4.  **Identify Moving Scan**: MainPresenter must correctly identify
        which of the two scans (sourceScanId, targetScanId) provided to
        startAutomaticAlignment() is the one that is \"moving\" (i.e.,
        the source scan that gets transformed). This information needs
        to be passed to PointCloudViewerWidget if it manages multiple
        loaded scans internally.

  - **References between Files**:

    - ICPRegistration.h / ICPRegistration.cpp: progressUpdated signal
      carries currentTransformation.

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp: Relays progressUpdated
      signal.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: startAutomaticAlignment() (or
      its connected slot) receives progressUpdated and calls
      PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform(). Needs to know the
      \"moving\" scan ID.

    - PointCloudViewerWidget.h / PointCloudViewerWidget.cpp:
      setDynamicTransform() (implemented in S2.2).

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - When ICP is running, the source point cloud in the 3D viewer
      continuously and smoothly updates its position, visually moving
      closer to the target point cloud with each iteration.

    - The intermediate transformations applied are non-permanent and
      only for preview purposes.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: MainPresenter relays intermediate transform.

      - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine to emit progressUpdated
        signals with a sequence of known, incrementally improving
        TransformationMatrix values. Mock PointCloudViewerWidget.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter calls
        PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform() repeatedly with
        the correct intermediate transformations.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Live Preview.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, misaligned scans
        (e.g., scan_A and scan_B with scan_A slightly offset from
        scan_B). User initiates ICP.

      - **Expected Result**: Observe scan_A (the source scan)
        continuously and smoothly moving towards scan_B (the target
        scan) until convergence.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

- **User Story 3**: As a user, I want to be able to cancel an ongoing
  ICP computation.

  - **Description**: Users need the ability to stop a long-running ICP
    process if it\'s not converging well, is stuck, or they\'ve made a
    mistake in setup.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **\"Cancel\" Button in ICPProgressWidget**: The
        ICPProgressWidget already has a \"Cancel\" button.

    2.  **Connect cancelRequested Signal**: Connect
        ICPProgressWidget::cancelRequested() signal to a new slot in
        MainPresenter: cancelAutomaticAlignment().

    3.  **Implement MainPresenter::cancelAutomaticAlignment()**: This
        slot will call AlignmentEngine::cancelAutomaticAlignment().

    4.  **Implement AlignmentEngine::cancelAutomaticAlignment()**: This
        method will call ICPRegistration::cancel().

    5.  **Implement ICPRegistration::cancel()**: This method (already
        defined in src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.h) needs to set an
        internal atomic flag (e.g., m_isCancelled). The
        ICPRegistration::compute() loop must check this flag in each
        iteration and break if it\'s set.

    6.  **Handle Cancellation Completion**: When ICPRegistration detects
        cancellation, it should emit computationFinished(false, \...,
        iterations) to indicate non-successful termination.
        MainPresenter will then handle the UI state for cancellation
        (e.g., status message, hiding progress).

  - **References between Files**:

    - ICPProgressWidget.h / ICPProgressWidget.cpp: Has \"Cancel\"
      button, emits cancelRequested().

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Adds
      cancelAutomaticAlignment() slot, connects to ICPProgressWidget.
      Calls AlignmentEngine::cancelAutomaticAlignment().

    - AlignmentEngine.h / AlignmentEngine.cpp: Adds
      cancelAutomaticAlignment() method, calls
      ICPRegistration::cancel().

    - ICPRegistration.h / ICPRegistration.cpp: Adds void cancel();
      method (sets m_isCancelled flag), compute() loop checks
      m_isCancelled, emits computationFinished(false, \...) on
      cancellation.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - A \"Cancel\" button is visible and active in the ICPProgressWidget
      when ICP is running.

    - Clicking the \"Cancel\" button stops the ICP computation.

    - The ICPProgressWidget reflects the cancellation (e.g., status
      \"Cancelled\", progress stops).

    - No transformations are permanently applied to the point clouds if
      cancelled.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: ICPProgressWidget emits cancel.

      - **Test Data**: N/A.

      - **Expected Result**: Clicking \"Cancel\" button emits
        cancelRequested().

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_icpprogreswidget.cpp).

    - **Test Case 2**: MainPresenter relays cancel.

      - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine.

      - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter::cancelAutomaticAlignment()
        calls AlignmentEngine::cancelAutomaticAlignment().

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    - **Test Case 3**: ICPRegistration cancels execution.

      - **Test Data**: Provide a PointCloud with enough points to ensure
        multiple iterations.

      - **Expected Result**: Call ICPRegistration::compute(), then
        ICPRegistration::cancel(). The compute() method returns early,
        and computationFinished(false, \...) is emitted.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_icpregistration.cpp).

    - **Test Case 4**: End-to-End Cancellation.

      - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, misaligned scans.
        User initiates ICP.

      - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Cancel\" in the
        ICPProgressWidget. The computation stops, the ICPProgressWidget
        indicates cancellation, and the viewer reverts to the state
        before ICP started (no live preview).

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

## Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)

1.  **New File Creation**:

    - No new files are created in this sub-sprint. All changes occur in
      existing files.

2.  **Frontend (UI Components)**:

    - **ICPProgressWidget (src/ui/src/ICPProgressWidget.cpp and
      src/ui/include/ui/ICPProgressWidget.h)**:

      - **UI Elements**: Ensure it has QProgressBar\* m_progressBar;,
        QLabel\* m_statusLabel;, QLabel\* m_iterationLabel;, QLabel\*
        m_errorLabel;, QLabel\* m_timeLabel;, QPushButton\*
        m_cancelButton;.

      - **startMonitoring(ICPRegistration\* icpAlgorithm, int
        maxIterations)**: This public method is the entry point. It will
        connect to the icpAlgorithm\'s signals.

      - **updateProgress(int iteration, float rmsError, const
        QMatrix4x4& transformation)**: Implement fully to update all
        labels and the progress bar.

      - **onComputationFinished(bool success, const QMatrix4x4&
        finalTransformation, float finalRMSError, int iterations)**:
        Implement to display final status, hide \"Cancel\" button, show
        \"Close\" button, and stop timers.

      - **onCancelClicked()**: Emits cancelRequested() signal.

      - **Internal Timer**: Use a QTimer to update m_timeLabel
        regularly.

      - **resetDisplay()**: Implement to reset all UI elements to
        initial state before startMonitoring().

    - **MainPresenter (src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp)**:

      - In handleAutomaticAlignmentClicked():

        - Instantiate ICPProgressWidget\* m_icpProgressWidget = new
          ICPProgressWidget(static_cast\<QWidget\*\>(m_view));

        - Call
          m_icpProgressWidget-\>startMonitoring(m_alignmentEngine.get(),
          maxIterationsFromDialog); (ensure AlignmentEngine is a QObject
          and can accept ICPRegistration\* or is the ICPRegistration
          itself).

        - Connect m_icpProgressWidget-\>cancelRequested to
          MainPresenter::cancelAutomaticAlignment().

      - Add public slot void cancelAutomaticAlignment();.

      - In cancelAutomaticAlignment(): Call
        m_alignmentEngine-\>cancelAutomaticAlignment();.

3.  **Backend (Core Logic/Services)**:

    - **ICPRegistration (src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.h /
      src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.cpp)**:

      - **Member**: std::atomic\<bool\> m_isCancelled; initialized to
        false.

      - **Method**: void cancel(); sets m_isCancelled = true;.

      - **compute() method**:

        - At the beginning of the for loop (or main while loop), add if
          (m_isCancelled) break;.

        - After the loop, emit computationFinished(success,
          currentTransform, finalError, iteration);. Ensure success is
          false if m_isCancelled is true.

        - Inside the loop, emit progressUpdated(iteration, currentError,
          currentTransform);.

    - **AlignmentEngine (src/registration/AlignmentEngine.h /
      src/registration/AlignmentEngine.cpp)**:

      - **Method**: void startAutomaticAlignment(const QString&
        sourceScanId, const QString& targetScanId, const ICPParams&
        params);

        - Within this method, instantiate the PointToPlaneICP (or
          ICPRegistration) algorithm: m_icpAlgorithm =
          std::make_unique\<PointToPlaneICP\>(this);.

        - Connect m_icpAlgorithm\'s progressUpdated to
          AlignmentEngine\'s own progressUpdated signal (to relay to
          MainPresenter).

        - Connect m_icpAlgorithm\'s computationFinished to
          AlignmentEngine\'s own computationFinished (to relay).

        - Call m_icpAlgorithm-\>compute(workingSource, workingTarget,
          initialGuess, params);.

      - **Method**: void cancelAutomaticAlignment();

        - Call m_icpAlgorithm-\>cancel(); (where m_icpAlgorithm is the
          active ICP instance).

      - **Member**: std::unique_ptr\<ICPRegistration\> m_icpAlgorithm;
        to hold the current ICP instance.

## References between Files (Consolidated)

- **MainPresenter** launches and controls **ICPProgressWidget**.

- **MainPresenter** triggers and listens to **AlignmentEngine**.

- **AlignmentEngine** orchestrates **ICPRegistration** (specifically
  PointToPlaneICP).

- **ICPRegistration** performs the computation and emits
  **progressUpdated** and **computationFinished** signals.

- **AlignmentEngine** relays these signals to **MainPresenter**.

- **MainPresenter** passes intermediate transformations to
  **PointCloudViewerWidget** via setDynamicTransform().

- **ICPProgressWidget** has a \"Cancel\" button that signals back to
  **MainPresenter**, which in turn calls **AlignmentEngine** and
  **ICPRegistration**.

## List of Files being Created

- No new files are created in this sub-sprint. All changes occur in
  existing files.

## Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated)

- When ICP is initiated, the ICPProgressWidget (modal dialog) appears,
  showing the title \"ICP Registration in Progress\".

- The ICPProgressWidget displays the current iteration number, RMS
  error, and elapsed time, updating dynamically.

- The QProgressBar in ICPProgressWidget accurately reflects the
  percentage of iterations completed.

- The 3D viewer continuously updates to show the intermediate
  transformation of the source point cloud as ICP progresses.

- A \"Cancel\" button is available in the ICPProgressWidget and, when
  clicked, gracefully stops the ICP computation.

- Upon cancellation, the ICPProgressWidget indicates \"Cancelled\", and
  the viewer reverts to the state before ICP started (no live preview).

## Testing Plan (Consolidated)

- **Unit Test**: test_icpprogreswidget.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: UI update synchronization.

    - **Test Data**: Call updateProgress() multiple times with varying
      iteration, rmsError values.

    - **Expected Result**: All QLabels and QProgressBar in the widget
      correctly reflect the input values.

  - **Test Case 2**: \"Cancel\" button functionality.

    - **Test Data**: Click the \"Cancel\" button.

    - **Expected Result**: The cancelRequested() signal is emitted.

  - **Test Case 3**: onComputationFinished() display.

    - **Test Data**: Call onComputationFinished() with both success=true
      and success=false.

    - **Expected Result**: The widget displays appropriate
      success/failure messages and button visibility.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test.

- **Unit Test**: test_icpregistration.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: Progress signal emission.

    - **Test Data**: Provide sufficient source/target points for
      multiple iterations.

    - **Expected Result**: progressUpdated signal is emitted for each
      iteration with valid iteration, rmsError, and transformation.

  - **Test Case 2**: Cancellation behavior.

    - **Test Data**: Start compute(), then immediately call cancel().

    - **Expected Result**: compute() terminates early, and
      computationFinished(false, \...) is emitted. The returned
      transformation is not final.

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Test / Qt Test (QSignalSpy).

- **Unit Test**: test_mainpresenter.cpp

  - **Test Case 1**: ICP launch and progress relay.

    - **Test Data**: Mock AlignmentEngine to emit progressUpdated
      signals. Mock ICPProgressWidget and PointCloudViewerWidget.

    - **Expected Result**: startAutomaticAlignment() configures
      ICPProgressWidget and ensures
      PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform() is called.
      MainPresenter correctly relays progressUpdated to
      ICPProgressWidget.

  - **Test Case 2**: ICP cancellation relay.

    - **Test Data**: Mock ICPProgressWidget to emit cancelRequested().
      Mock AlignmentEngine.

    - **Expected Result**: MainPresenter calls
      AlignmentEngine::cancelAutomaticAlignment().

  - **Testing Tool**: Google Mock / Qt Test.

- **Integration Test**: Automatic Alignment Execution & Live Preview.

  - **Test Case 1**: Successful ICP execution with live preview.

    - **Test Data**: Application with two loaded, significantly
      misaligned scans. User launches ICP.

    - **Expected Result**:

      1.  The ICPProgressWidget appears.

      2.  Observe the iteration number, RMS error, and elapsed time
          updating live.

      3.  Observe the source point cloud visually moving and rotating
          into alignment with the target point cloud in the 3D viewer.

      4.  The process completes successfully after some iterations.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script.

  - **Test Case 2**: ICP Cancellation.

    - **Test Data**: Same as Test Case 1.

    - **Expected Result**: User clicks \"Cancel\" in ICPProgressWidget.
      The computation stops. The ICPProgressWidget indicates
      \"Cancelled\". The viewer stops updating its dynamic preview and
      reverts to the state before ICP started.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 4.1 Completion**: The ICPParameterDialog and its
  integration to launch AlignmentEngine::startAutomaticAlignment() are
  fully functional.

- **PointToPlaneICP (or ICPRegistration base)**: The compute() method in
  src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.cpp (and its overrides in
  PointToPlaneICP.cpp) is capable of iterative computation and producing
  intermediate transformations.

- **PointCloudViewerWidget::setDynamicTransform()**: This method (from
  Sub-Sprint 2.2) works correctly for live preview.

- **AlignmentEngine as Orchestrator**: AlignmentEngine successfully
  fetches scan data and manages the ICPRegistration instance.

- **UI Threading**: For a responsive UI, it\'s assumed that the
  ICPRegistration::compute() method (or a wrapper within
  AlignmentEngine) will eventually run in a separate thread, with
  progressUpdated signals marshaled to the UI thread via
  Qt::QueuedConnection. For now, QApplication::processEvents() is a
  temporary workaround.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The live preview and progress updates should be
  smooth and not cause UI freezing. The iteration speed should be
  acceptable for the point cloud size.

- **Usability**: The progress widget should be intuitive and provide all
  necessary information for the user to monitor ICP progress.

- **Responsiveness**: The \"Cancel\" functionality should be immediate
  and stop the computation quickly.

- **Accuracy**: The displayed RMS error should be accurate to the
  algorithm\'s internal calculations.

- **Robustness**: The application should not crash if ICP parameters
  lead to non-convergence or other issues; it should report errors
  gracefully.

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 4.2 significantly enhances the automated registration
workflow by providing essential real-time feedback and user control.
Implementing live progress updates and a cancellation mechanism
increases user confidence and makes the ICP feature more practical and
usable.
