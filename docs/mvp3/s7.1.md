# Detailed Backlog: Sprint 7, Sub-Sprint 7.1 - Pose Graph Construction & Basic Display

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sub-Sprint 7.1: Pose Graph
Construction & Basic Display. This sub-sprint introduces the
foundational elements for global optimization: constructing a PoseGraph
from existing pairwise registrations and providing a basic visualization
of this graph to the user. This is a crucial step for managing large,
multi-scan projects and is part of the Production Hardening phase.

## User Stories

- **User Story 1**: As a user, I want the application to automatically
  build a PoseGraph from my existing project registrations.

  - **Description**: For projects with multiple interconnected scans,
    manually tracking all pairwise registrations is difficult. The
    application should automatically identify all scans and their direct
    registrations (edges) to form a graph structure that represents the
    overall project connectivity.

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Modify MainPresenter::handleLoadProject()**: After a project
        is successfully loaded and RegistrationProject is populated,
        call a new method MainPresenter::rebuildPoseGraph().

    2.  **Implement MainPresenter::rebuildPoseGraph()**:

        - Get all RegistrationProject::RegistrationResults from
          m_registrationProject-\>getRegistrationResults().

        - Instantiate Registration::PoseGraphBuilder builder;.

        - Call builder.build(allRegistrationResults); (or pass the
          RegistrationProject itself if PoseGraphBuilder operates
          directly on it).

        - Store the resulting Registration::PoseGraph (e.g.,
          std::unique_ptr\<Registration::PoseGraph\> m_currentPoseGraph;
          in MainPresenter).

        - Notify the UI (via IMainView or a new specialized viewer) that
          the graph is ready for display.

    3.  **Implement Registration::PoseGraphBuilder::build()**: In
        src/registration/src/PoseGraphBuilder.cpp, implement this method
        to:

        - Initialize an empty Registration::PoseGraph.

        - Iterate through the QList\<RegistrationResult\> provided.

        - For each RegistrationResult, extract sourceScanId,
          targetScanId, and transformation.

        - Add PoseNodes for sourceScanId and targetScanId to the
          PoseGraph (if they don\'t already exist).

        - Add a PoseEdge between the sourceScanId node and targetScanId
          node, using the transformation from the RegistrationResult as
          the edge\'s relative transform.

        - Ensure PoseNodes and PoseEdges store necessary metadata (e.g.,
          RMS error on edge).

        - Return the constructed Registration::PoseGraph.

  - **References between Files**:

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: rebuildPoseGraph() (new),
      stores m_currentPoseGraph, calls PoseGraphBuilder.

    - RegistrationProject.h / RegistrationProject.cpp:
      getRegistrationResults() (provides input to builder).

    - Registration::PoseGraphBuilder.h / PoseGraphBuilder.cpp: build()
      method (new/modified).

    - Registration::PoseGraph.h / PoseGraph.cpp: addNode(), addEdge()
      methods (used by builder).

    - Registration::PoseNode.h, Registration::PoseEdge.h:
      Structs/classes defining graph elements.

    - RegistrationProject::RegistrationResult: Contains data to build
      edges.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - After a project with existing registrations is loaded,
      MainPresenter successfully constructs a Registration::PoseGraph
      object.

    - The constructed PoseGraph accurately represents the connectivity
      defined by the RegistrationProject::RegistrationResult entries.

    - Each PoseNode corresponds to a unique scan, and each PoseEdge
      corresponds to a unique RegistrationResult.

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: PoseGraphBuilder::build() correctness - simple
      chain.

      - **Test Data**: Create a mock RegistrationProject with:

        - Scan A, Scan B, Scan C.

        - RegistrationResult (A to B, T_AB).

        - RegistrationResult (B to C, T_BC).

      - **Expected Result**: build() returns a PoseGraph with 3 nodes
        (A, B, C) and 2 edges (A-B, B-C) with correct transforms.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_posegraphbuilder.cpp - new
        file).

    - **Test Case 2**: PoseGraphBuilder::build() correctness - loop
      closure.

      - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject with:

        - Scan A, Scan B, Scan C.

        - RegistrationResult (A to B, T_AB).

        - RegistrationResult (B to C, T_BC).

        - RegistrationResult (C to A, T_CA).

      - **Expected Result**: build() returns a PoseGraph with 3 nodes
        and 3 edges forming a loop.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_posegraphbuilder.cpp).

    - **Test Case 3**: PoseGraphBuilder::build() correctness -
      disconnected components.

      - **Test Data**: Mock RegistrationProject with:

        - Scan A, Scan B, Scan C, Scan D.

        - RegistrationResult (A to B).

        - RegistrationResult (C to D).

      - **Expected Result**: build() returns a PoseGraph representing
        two disconnected subgraphs.

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_posegraphbuilder.cpp).

- **User Story 2**: As a user, I want to visualize the connectivity of
  my registered scans in a simple graph view.

  - **Description**: A visual representation of the PoseGraph allows
    users to quickly grasp the relationships between their scans and
    identify potential issues (e.g., isolated scans, complex loops).

  - **Actions to Undertake**:

    1.  **Create PoseGraphViewerWidget**: Create new files
        src/ui/include/ui/PoseGraphViewerWidget.h and
        src/ui/src/PoseGraphViewerWidget.cpp. This widget will be a
        QWidget containing a QGraphicsView and QGraphicsScene to render
        the graph.

    2.  **Integrate PoseGraphViewerWidget into UI**:

        - Add a new tab or panel in RegistrationWorkflowWidget or
          SidebarWidget for \"Pose Graph\".

        - Instantiate PoseGraphViewerWidget and set it as the layout for
          this new tab/panel.

    3.  **Implement PoseGraphViewerWidget::displayGraph()**:

        - Add public method void displayGraph(const
          Registration::PoseGraph& graph);

        - Clear the existing QGraphicsScene.

        - For each PoseNode in graph:

          - Create a QGraphicsEllipseItem (for node representation).

          - Add a QGraphicsTextItem for the scan ID.

          - Position nodes (simple layout for MVP, e.g., circular layout
            or random).

        - For each PoseEdge in graph:

          - Create a QGraphicsLineItem between connected nodes.

          - (Optional) Add a QGraphicsTextItem or change color for RMS
            error visualization.

        - Set the scene rect to encompass all items.

    4.  **MainPresenter Triggers Display**: After m_currentPoseGraph is
        constructed in MainPresenter::rebuildPoseGraph(), call
        m_poseGraphViewer-\>displayGraph(\*m_currentPoseGraph);.

    5.  **Initial View**: Ensure PoseGraphViewerWidget can pan and zoom
        the graph.

  - **References between Files**:

    - PoseGraphViewerWidget.h / PoseGraphViewerWidget.cpp: New UI
      component using QGraphicsView, QGraphicsScene.

    - MainPresenter.h / MainPresenter.cpp: Stores m_currentPoseGraph,
      calls PoseGraphViewerWidget::displayGraph().

    - RegistrationWorkflowWidget.h / RegistrationWorkflowWidget.cpp or
      SidebarWidget.h / SidebarWidget.cpp: Integrates
      PoseGraphViewerWidget.

    - Registration::PoseGraph.h: Provides graph structure for display.

    - Registration::PoseNode.h, Registration::PoseEdge.h: Provide data
      for drawing nodes/edges.

  - **Acceptance Criteria**:

    - A new \"Pose Graph\" tab/panel is available in the application\'s
      UI.

    - When a project with registrations is loaded, the
      PoseGraphViewerWidget automatically displays a 2D visualization of
      the PoseGraph.

    - The visualization clearly shows nodes (representing scans) and
      edges (representing registrations) connecting them.

    - Nodes are labeled with scan IDs.

    - The viewer allows basic interaction (e.g., pan, zoom).

  - **Testing Plan**:

    - **Test Case 1**: PoseGraphViewerWidget renders nodes and edges.

      - **Test Data**: Create a simple Registration::PoseGraph (e.g., 3
        nodes, 2 edges). Call displayGraph().

      - **Expected Result**: QGraphicsScene contains correct number of
        QGraphicsEllipseItem and QGraphicsLineItems. Items are
        positioned and labeled correctly (visual inspection or
        programmatic item count/property check).

      - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_posegraphviewerwidget.cpp -
        new file).

    - **Test Case 2**: End-to-End Pose Graph Display.

      - **Test Data**: Application with multiple loaded scans and
        existing registrations (e.g., a small chain or loop).

      - **Expected Result**: Launch app, load project. Navigate to
        \"Pose Graph\" tab. Observe the graph visualization accurately
        reflecting the project\'s connectivity.

      - **Testing Tool**: Integration test (manual observation).

        pointer to viewer widget).

      - Add void rebuildPoseGraph(); private method.

      - In handleLoadProjectCompleted() (or similar after project is
        loaded/updated): Call rebuildPoseGraph();.

      - In rebuildPoseGraph():

        - m_currentPoseGraph =
          std::make_unique\<Registration::PoseGraph\>();

        - \*m_currentPoseGraph =
          Registration::PoseGraphBuilder::build(m_registrationProject-\>getRegistrationResults());

        - m_poseGraphViewer-\>displayGraph(\*m_currentPoseGraph);
          (Ensure m_poseGraphViewer is initialized and valid).

    - **PoseGraphViewerWidget (src/ui/src/PoseGraphViewerWidget.cpp)**:

        graph);

      - Uses QGraphicsScene and QGraphicsView.

      - Clears existing scene content.

      - Iterates graph.nodes(): Creates QGraphicsEllipseItem for node,

      nodes, 1 edge). Call displayGraph().

    - **Expected Result**: QGraphicsScene contains QGraphicsEllipseItems
      for nodes and QGraphicsLineItems for edges. Node labels are
      correct. (Visual inspection or programmatic item count/property
      verification).

    - **Testing Tool**: Unit test (test_posegraphviewerwidget.cpp),
      visual inspection.

      4.  (Optional) Verify pan/zoom functionality.

    - **Testing Tool**: Manual QA / UI automation script.

## Assumptions and Dependencies

- **Sub-Sprint 6.4 Completion**: The entire quality reporting workflow
  (including accepted registrations and RegistrationResult storage) is
  fully implemented and stable.

- **RegistrationProject::getRegistrationResults()**: This method
  reliably provides a complete list of RegistrationResults for the
  current project.

- **Qt Graphics Framework**: QGraphicsView and QGraphicsScene are
  available and suitable for basic 2D graph rendering.

- **Mathematical Types**: QMatrix4x4 and QVector3D are correctly used
  for transformations and positions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: The pose graph visualization should be clear and
  intuitive, providing immediate insight into project structure.

- **Performance**: Building and displaying the pose graph should be
  fast, even for projects with many scans (e.g., dozens of scans).

- **Maintainability**: The PoseGraph data structures and
  PoseGraphBuilder are modular and easy to extend for future
  optimization algorithms.

- **Scalability**: The graph visualization should remain functional and
  readable for a reasonable number of scans and connections (e.g., up to
  50-100 nodes).

## Conclusion

Sub-Sprint 7.1 establishes the foundation for global optimization by
enabling the automatic construction and visualization of the PoseGraph.
This provides users with critical insight into their multi-scan projects
and prepares the application for advanced accuracy improvements in
subsequent sprints.
