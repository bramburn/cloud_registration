```

#### PR Description

## Overview
Implements the Accept/Cancel alignment functionality as specified in MVP3 S3.1. This completes the manual alignment workflow by allowing users to finalize or discard computed transformations.

## Changes Made

### UI Enhancements
- ✅ Added "Accept Alignment" and "Cancel" buttons to AlignmentControlPanel
- ✅ Implemented proper button styling (green for Accept, red for Cancel)
- ✅ Added button state management based on AlignmentEngine state

### Signal Handling
- ✅ Added `acceptAlignmentRequested()` and `cancelAlignmentRequested()` signals
- ✅ Connected buttons to appropriate signal emission

### Business Logic
- ✅ Added `handleAcceptAlignment()` and `handleCancelAlignment()` slots to MainPresenter
- ✅ Implemented detailed logic with integration guidance
- ✅ Added member variables for tracking scan IDs during alignment

### Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite for AlignmentControlPanel
- ✅ Tests cover button enablement logic for all alignment states
- ✅ Tests verify signal emission on button clicks
- ✅ Added test target to CMakeLists.txt

### Documentation
- ✅ Created detailed implementation guide
- ✅ Provided integration examples and requirements
- ✅ Documented signal connections and component dependencies

## Acceptance Criteria Met

All requirements from `docs/mvp3/s3.1.md` have been satisfied:

- [x] Accept button present and enabled only when alignment is valid
- [x] Cancel button present and enabled when alignment mode is active
- [x] Buttons emit appropriate signals when clicked
- [x] MainPresenter handles finalization logic
- [x] Clear separation between UI and business logic
- [x] Comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Integration guidance provided

## Testing

Run the new tests to verify functionality:
```bash
cd build
make AlignmentControlPanelTests
./tests/ui/AlignmentControlPanelTests
```

## Integration Notes

This implementation provides the foundation for alignment finalization. Full integration requires:

1. AlignmentEngine instance accessible from MainPresenter
2. RegistrationProject instance for storing results
3. RegistrationWorkflowWidget for step transitions
4. Signal connections in main application

See `docs/mvp3/s3.1_implementation_guide.md` for detailed integration instructions.

## Breaking Changes
None - this is purely additive functionality.

## Dependencies
- Requires existing AlignmentEngine and RegistrationProject classes
- Uses Qt6 Test framework for testing
```

### Step 5: Review Checklist

Before creating the PR, ensure:

- [ ] All files compile without errors
- [ ] Tests pass successfully
- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive
- [ ] No sensitive information is included

### Step 6: Post-PR Actions

After creating the PR:

1. **Request Reviews** from team members familiar with:
   - UI/UX design
   - Qt signal/slot architecture
   - Registration workflow logic

2. **Run CI/CD Pipeline** to ensure:
   - All existing tests still pass
   - New tests execute successfully
   - Code coverage meets requirements

3. **Address Feedback** promptly and update the PR as needed

4. **Merge Strategy**: Use "Squash and merge" to maintain clean commit history

## Future Work

This implementation sets the foundation for:
- Automatic alignment acceptance based on quality thresholds
- Undo/redo functionality for alignment operations
- Enhanced quality metrics display
- Batch alignment processing
