# Sprint 2 Backlog: E57 Library Integration - Uncompressed Point Data Extraction (XYZ)

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 31, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 Library Integration (prd_libe57_integration)
**Sprint Goal:** Enable the `E57ParserLib` to access scan data, interpret point prototypes, extract uncompressed Cartesian (XYZ) point data from the first scan of an E57 file using `libE57Format`, convert this data into the application's standard format (`std::vector<float>`), and integrate with existing application signals for progress and completion.

## 1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint 2 of the "E57 Library Integration" project. Building upon the library setup and basic header reading capabilities established in Sprint 1, this sprint focuses on the core functionality of extracting actual 3D point data (specifically uncompressed X, Y, Z coordinates) from E57 files. This involves navigating to scan data sections, understanding the point record structure via the E57 prototype, reading binary point data in blocks, and converting it into a format usable by the main application. This sprint directly addresses the tasks outlined for "Sprint 2: Uncompressed Point Data Extraction (XYZ) (2 Weeks)" in the main PRD.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story 1: Access and Interpret Scan Data Structure

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57ParserLib` to navigate to the first `Data3D` (scan) section within an E57 file and correctly interpret its `points` `CompressedVectorNode` prototype,
* **So that** the parser understands the structure (e.g., presence of `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ` fields) and data types of the point records before attempting to read them.
    * **Description**: This story focuses on enabling the parser to locate the primary point data container within an E57 file. It involves accessing the `/data3D` vector, selecting the first scan (Data3D entry), and then interrogating the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` to find its `prototype`. The prototype defines what fields (like `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ`) exist for each point and their E57 data types (e.g., `FloatNode` with single or double precision). This information is crucial for setting up the correct buffers for reading.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 2.1.1**: Extend `E57ParserLib` to access the first `Data3D` `StructureNode` from the `/data3D` `VectorNode` (as identified in Sprint 1, Task 1.2.5).
            * *Input*: Opened `e57::ImageFile` instance.
            * *Output*: `e57::StructureNode` representing the first scan's header.
            * *Reference Code (Accessing first scan header)*:
                ```cpp
                // Assuming imf is the e57::ImageFile* and rootNode is imf->root()
                // e57::VectorNode data3DVectorNode = static_cast<e57::VectorNode>(rootNode.get("/data3D"));
                // if (data3DVectorNode.childCount() > 0) {
                //     e57::StructureNode firstScanHeaderNode = static_cast<e57::StructureNode>(data3DVectorNode.get(0));
                //     // ... process firstScanHeaderNode
                // }
                ```
        * **Task 2.1.2**: From the scan header node, locate the `points` child node, validate it's an `e57::CompressedVectorNode`, and retrieve its `prototype` (`e57::StructureNode`).
            * *Input*: `e57::StructureNode` for the scan header.
            * *Output*: `e57::StructureNode` for the point prototype.
            * *Reference Code (Getting prototype)*:
                ```cpp
                // Assuming scanHeaderNode is the e57::StructureNode for the current scan
                // if (scanHeaderNode.isDefined("points") && scanHeaderNode.get("points").type() == e57::E57_COMPRESSED_VECTOR) {
                //     e57::CompressedVectorNode cvNode = static_cast<e57::CompressedVectorNode>(scanHeaderNode.get("points"));
                //     e57::StructureNode pointPrototype = cvNode.prototype();
                //     // ... inspect pointPrototype
                // }
                ```
        * **Task 2.1.3**: Implement logic to inspect the `pointPrototype` to identify the presence and E57 data types of `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, and `cartesianZ` fields. Store this information (e.g., field names, expected precision) for buffer setup.
            * *Input*: `e57::StructureNode` for the point prototype.
            * *Output*: Internal representation of required fields and their types.
            * *Reference Code (Inspecting prototype field)*:
                ```cpp
                // For each child in pointPrototype:
                // e57::Node fieldNode = pointPrototype.get(fieldIndex);
                // std::string fieldName = fieldNode.elementName();
                // e57::NodeType fieldType = fieldNode.type();
                // if (fieldName == "cartesianX" && fieldType == e57::E57_FLOAT) {
                //     e57::FloatNode xNode = static_cast<e57::FloatNode>(fieldNode);
                //     e57::Precision xPrecision = xNode.precision(); // e57::PrecisionSingle or e57::PrecisionDouble
                //     // Store this info
                // }
                ```
        * **Task 2.1.4**: Handle cases where `cartesianX/Y/Z` are missing or have unexpected types in the prototype, reporting appropriate errors.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57parser_lib.cpp` will implement this logic, using `libE57Format` API.
        * `src/e57parser_lib.h` will declare methods to trigger this and store prototype information.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The parser can successfully locate the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` for the first scan in a valid E57 file.
        2.  The parser correctly identifies the presence of `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, and `cartesianZ` fields within the `prototype`.
        3.  The parser determines the E57 data type (e.g., `FloatNode`) and precision (single/double) for these coordinate fields.
        4.  If essential coordinate fields are missing from the prototype, an appropriate error is logged and reported.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 2.1.1**: Parse an E57 file with a standard prototype (XYZ as double-precision floats).
            * **Test Data**: E57 file like `sample/bunnyDouble.e57` or a test file with known XYZ double prototype.
            * **Expected Result**: Parser correctly identifies XYZ fields and their double precision. No errors.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, debugger.
        * **Test Case 2.1.2**: Parse an E57 file where the prototype is missing `cartesianZ`.
            * **Test Data**: Custom E57 file with prototype lacking `cartesianZ`.
            * **Expected Result**: Parser reports an error indicating missing `cartesianZ`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 2.1.3**: Parse an E57 file where `cartesianX` is, for example, an `IntegerNode` instead of `FloatNode`.
            * **Test Data**: Custom E57 file with `cartesianX` as `IntegerNode`.
            * **Expected Result**: Parser reports an error about unexpected data type for `cartesianX`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.

### User Story 2: Extract and Convert Uncompressed XYZ Point Data

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57ParserLib` to read uncompressed Cartesian (X, Y, Z) point data from the identified `CompressedVectorNode` in blocks, and convert it into a `std::vector<float>` format,
* **So that** the application can receive point cloud geometry in its standard internal representation.
    * **Description**: This story covers the actual reading of point data. Based on the prototype information gathered in User Story 1, appropriate `e57::SourceDestBuffer` objects will be configured for `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, and `cartesianZ`. An `e57::CompressedVectorReader` will be used to read data in blocks. The read data (likely `double`s from `libE57Format`) will be converted to `float`s and aggregated into a single `std::vector<float>` (interleaved X, Y, Z).
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 2.2.1**: Implement buffer preparation logic. Create `std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer>` and configure buffers for `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ` based on the inspected prototype. Assume reading into `double` C++ buffers initially.
            * *Input*: Prototype information, `e57::ImageFile* imf`.
            * *Output*: Populated `std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer> sdbufs`.
            * *Reference Code (Preparing SourceDestBuffer for cartesianX)*:
                ```cpp
                // const int64_t POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK = 65536; // Example
                // std::vector<double> xBuffer_d(POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK);
                // std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer> sdbufs;
                // if (/* cartesianX identified as FloatNode in prototype */) {
                //    sdbufs.emplace_back(imf, "cartesianX", xBuffer_d.data(), POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK, true, false, sizeof(double));
                // }
                // // Similar for yBuffer_d, zBuffer_d
                ```
        * **Task 2.2.2**: Create an `e57::CompressedVectorReader` for the `points` `CompressedVectorNode` using the prepared `SourceDestBuffers`.
            * *Input*: `e57::CompressedVectorNode cvNode`, `std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer> sdbufs`.
            * *Output*: `e57::CompressedVectorReader reader`.
            * *Reference Code*: `e57::CompressedVectorReader reader = cvNode.reader(sdbufs);`
        * **Task 2.2.3**: Implement a loop to read point data in blocks using `reader.read()`.
            * *Input*: `e57::CompressedVectorReader reader`.
            * *Output*: Populated C++ buffers (`xBuffer_d`, `yBuffer_d`, `zBuffer_d`) for each block.
        * **Task 2.2.4**: Inside the loop, after each successful block read, convert the `double` coordinate values from the C++ buffers to `float` and append them to a main `std::vector<float> m_points` (member of `E57ParserLib`).
            * *Input*: Populated `double` buffers, number of points read in the block.
            * *Output*: `m_points` vector appended with new float data.
        * **Task 2.2.5**: Ensure `reader.close()` is called after the loop finishes or if an error occurs.
        * **Task 2.2.6**: Implement robust error handling for `reader.read()` operations, catching `e57::E57Exception`.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57parser_lib.cpp` will contain the core implementation.
        * `src/e57parser_lib.h` will declare methods for initiating point data reading and storing the resulting `std::vector<float>`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The parser correctly reads all XYZ point data from the first scan of an E57 file containing uncompressed `FloatNode` (double or single precision) coordinates.
        2.  The extracted `double` coordinate values are correctly converted to `float` and stored in an interleaved `std::vector<float>` (X1,Y1,Z1, X2,Y2,Z2,...).
        3.  The number of points read matches the `childCount()` of the `CompressedVectorNode`.
        4.  The `CompressedVectorReader` is properly closed after use.
        5.  Errors during `reader.read()` are caught and reported.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 2.2.1**: Parse an E57 file with known XYZ (double precision) point data.
            * **Test Data**: `sample/bunnyDouble.e57` or a test file with a few known 3D points (e.g., (1.0, 2.0, 3.0), (4.0, 5.0, 6.0)).
            * **Expected Result**: The output `std::vector<float>` contains the correct number of points, and the coordinate values match the known data (within float precision tolerance).
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 2.2.2**: Parse an E57 file with XYZ as single precision floats.
            * **Test Data**: Test E57 file where prototype specifies `cartesianX/Y/Z` as `FloatNode` with `PrecisionSingle`.
            * **Expected Result**: Data is read correctly and converted to the application's `std::vector<float>`.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 2.2.3**: Test with an E57 file containing a large number of points (e.g., > 1 million) to ensure block-wise reading works correctly and efficiently.
            * **Test Data**: A large E57 file.
            * **Expected Result**: All points are read successfully without excessive memory consumption during the read loop.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, performance profiler.
        * **Test Case 2.2.4**: Test error handling if `reader.read()` fails mid-stream (e.g., due to a corrupted binary section).
            * **Test Data**: A deliberately corrupted E57 file where the binary point data section is truncated.
            * **Expected Result**: Parser reports an error, and `parsingFinished` signal indicates failure. Partial data might be returned or an empty vector, depending on error recovery strategy.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.

### User Story 3: Integrate Data Extraction with Application Signals and Viewer

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57ParserLib` to emit `progressUpdated` signals during point data extraction and a `parsingFinished` signal upon completion (with success/failure status and the extracted `std::vector<float>`),
* **So that** the main application (`MainWindow`) can display progress to the user and the `PointCloudViewerWidget` can render the loaded points.
    * **Description**: This story ensures that the new E57 parsing process integrates smoothly with the existing application infrastructure. The `E57ParserLib` needs to provide feedback during potentially long data reading operations and signal its completion. The `MainWindow` will connect to these signals to update the UI (e.g., progress bar) and pass the final point data to the `PointCloudViewerWidget`.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 2.3.1**: Modify `E57ParserLib` to emit `progressUpdated(int percentage, const QString& stage)` signal periodically during the `reader.read()` loop. The percentage should reflect the proportion of total points read from the current scan.
            * *Input*: Current number of points read, total points in scan.
            * *Output*: `progressUpdated` signal emitted.
        * **Task 2.3.2**: Ensure `E57ParserLib` emits `parsingFinished(bool success, const QString& message, const std::vector<float>& points)` signal when point extraction is complete or an error occurs.
            * *Input*: Success status, error/success message, final `std::vector<float>` of points.
            * *Output*: `parsingFinished` signal emitted.
        * **Task 2.3.3**: (Conceptual, for `MainWindow` in a later sprint, but good to consider now) Ensure `MainWindow` correctly connects to these signals from `E57ParserLib`.
        * **Task 2.3.4**: (Conceptual, for `PointCloudViewerWidget` in a later sprint) Ensure `PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud(const std::vector<float>& points)` can accept and render the data format produced by `E57ParserLib`.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57parser_lib.h` will declare the `progressUpdated` and `parsingFinished` signals.
        * `src/e57parser_lib.cpp` will emit these signals.
        * `src/mainwindow.h/cpp` (in future sprints) will connect to these signals.
        * `src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h/cpp` (in future sprints) will consume the `std::vector<float>`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  `progressUpdated` signal is emitted multiple times during the processing of a scan with many points, with increasing percentage values.
        2.  `parsingFinished` signal is emitted once per parsing operation.
        3.  If parsing is successful, `parsingFinished` emits `success=true`, an appropriate message, and the non-empty `std::vector<float>` of points.
        4.  If parsing fails, `parsingFinished` emits `success=false`, a descriptive error message, and an empty `std::vector<float>`.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 2.3.1**: Use `QSignalSpy` in unit tests to verify `progressUpdated` signal emission.
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with a moderate number of points (e.g., 100k).
            * **Expected Result**: `progressUpdated` is emitted multiple times. The percentage values are incremental. The stage message is appropriate (e.g., "Reading points...").
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test with `QSignalSpy`.
        * **Test Case 2.3.2**: Use `QSignalSpy` to verify `parsingFinished` signal on successful parsing.
            * **Test Data**: Valid E57 file.
            * **Expected Result**: `parsingFinished` emitted once with `success=true`, a success message, and the correct point data.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test with `QSignalSpy`.
        * **Test Case 2.3.3**: Use `QSignalSpy` to verify `parsingFinished` signal on parsing failure (e.g., corrupted file).
            * **Test Data**: Corrupted E57 file.
            * **Expected Result**: `parsingFinished` emitted once with `success=false`, an error message, and an empty point vector.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test with `QSignalSpy`.
        * **Test Case 2.3.4 (Manual/Integration)**: (Simulated for this sprint, fully tested when `MainWindow` integration happens) Observe progress updates in a test application or logs, and verify that the extracted points, when passed to a mock viewer, appear correct.
            * **Test Data**: `sample/bunnyDouble.e57`.
            * **Expected Result**: Progress is shown. Final point data is visualized correctly (conceptually).
            * **Testing Tool**: Custom test application, debugger, visual inspection (mocked).

**Data Flows (Conceptual for this Sprint):**
1.  `E57ParserLib::parse()` (or a new method like `readPoints()`) is called.
2.  It navigates to the first `/data3D` scan entry.
3.  It inspects the `points.prototype` to identify `cartesianX`, `cartesianY`, `cartesianZ`.
4.  It prepares `SourceDestBuffer`s for these fields.
5.  It creates a `CompressedVectorReader`.
6.  It enters a loop:
    a.  Calls `reader.read()` to fill C++ `double` buffers.
    b.  Emits `progressUpdated` signal.
    c.  Converts `double`s to `float`s and appends to the main `std::vector<float>`.
7.  After the loop, calls `reader.close()`.
8.  Emits `parsingFinished` signal with the results.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint 2 is:
1.  The `E57ParserLib` can successfully read uncompressed X, Y, Z coordinate data from the first scan of an E57 file using `libE57Format`.
2.  The extracted point data is correctly converted to an interleaved `std::vector<float>`.
3.  The parser correctly identifies the structure of point data (presence of XYZ fields and their precision) from the E57 prototype.
4.  The parser handles block-wise reading of point data efficiently.
5.  Appropriate `progressUpdated` and `parsingFinished` signals are emitted with correct parameters.
6.  Robust error handling is in place for issues encountered during point data reading and prototype interpretation.
7.  Unit tests verify the functionality for various E57 file scenarios (different precisions, empty scans, files with only XYZ).

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Unit Tests (Google Test with Qt Test utilities for signals)**:
    * Focus on `E57ParserLib` methods for scan access, prototype interpretation, `SourceDestBuffer` setup, `CompressedVectorReader` usage, data conversion, and signal emission.
    * Use `QSignalSpy` to validate signal parameters and emission counts.
    * Test with various E57 files:
        * Simple file with few known XYZ points (double precision).
        * Simple file with few known XYZ points (single precision).
        * File with many points to test block reading and progress updates.
        * File with an empty scan (zero points).
        * File where the prototype is missing one or more Cartesian coordinate fields.
        * File where coordinate fields have unexpected E57 types.
* **Integration Tests (Conceptual for this sprint, focusing on data integrity):**
    * Create a small test harness that calls `E57ParserLib`, retrieves the `std::vector<float>`, and prints/validates a sample of the points. This ensures the end-to-end data flow within the parser library itself is correct. Full integration with `MainWindow` and `PointCloudViewerWidget` is for later sprints.

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint 2:**
* A minimal valid E57 file with a few known XYZ points (double precision).
* A minimal valid E57 file with a few known XYZ points (single precision).
* A valid E57 file with a larger number of points (e.g., 100k - 1M) for testing block reading and progress.
* An E57 file with a scan that contains zero points.
* An E57 file where the point prototype is missing `cartesianZ`.
* An E57 file where `cartesianX` is defined as an `IntegerNode` (to test error handling).
* `sample/bunnyDouble.e57` (if available and confirmed to have uncompressed XYZ).

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  Sprint 1 (Library Setup & Basic File Reading) has been successfully completed. `libE57Format` is integrated and basic file opening/metadata retrieval works.
    2.  The E57 files used for testing primarily contain uncompressed point data for XYZ coordinates, stored as `FloatNode`s (single or double precision) in the prototype.
    3.  For this sprint, the focus is on reading data from the *first* `Data3D` (scan) section encountered in the E57 file.
    4.  The application's internal representation for point cloud geometry is `std::vector<float>` (interleaved X, Y, Z).
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  Completed and functional `E57ParserLib` from Sprint 1.
    2.  `libE57Format` library (and its dependencies like Xerces-C) correctly linked.
    3.  C++ Compiler, CMake, vcpkg.
    4.  Google Test framework.
    5.  Qt 6 framework (Core, Testlib for `QSignalSpy`).

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1 (Performance - Data Extraction)**: Reading XYZ data from a `CompressedVectorNode` should be efficient. The block-wise reading approach should prevent excessive memory usage for large scans. Target throughput (e.g., X million points per second on benchmark hardware) should be considered, though full optimization is for later.
* **NFR2 (Accuracy)**: Extracted coordinate values must accurately represent the data stored in the E57 file, respecting precision (double/single) and correctly converting to the application's `float` representation.
* **NFR3 (Memory Management)**: Buffers used for reading point data blocks should be managed efficiently (e.g., reused) to minimize memory churn. The final `std::vector<float>` should be the primary large allocation.
* **NFR4 (Error Reporting)**: Errors encountered during prototype inspection or point data reading (e.g., unexpected data types, read failures) must be clearly reported via `getLastError()` and the `parsingFinished` signal.

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint 2 marks a significant step in the E57 library integration by enabling the extraction of core XYZ point data. Successfully completing this sprint will allow the application to load the fundamental geometry of point clouds from E57 files, paving the way for visualization and further processing in subsequent sprints. The focus on correct prototype interpretation, efficient block-wise reading, and robust error handling is crucial for building a reliable E57 import capability.
