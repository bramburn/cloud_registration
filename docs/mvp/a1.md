Ad-hoc Backlog: E57 Read/Write Module using libE57Format
1. Introduction

This ad-hoc backlog outlines the focused effort required to implement a complete and robust E57 read/write module. The primary goal is to abstract the complexities of the E57 file format from the rest of the application by creating a dedicated E57DataManager class.

This module will leverage the libe57format library, which was integrated during Sprint 1.1, and will encapsulate the functionality described in Sprint 1.2 (CRC validation and XML parsing) into a high-level, easy-to-use interface.
2. Clarification on PCL (Point Cloud Library) vs. libE57Format

To address your query directly: you are correct to focus on libe57format for reading and writing E57 files.

    libe57format: This library's role is strictly for file I/O. It is responsible for parsing the E57 file structure (XML and binary sections), reading the raw point data, and writing data back into the compliant E57 format. We will use this to build our E57DataManager.

    PCL (Point Cloud Library): This library's role is for point cloud processing and registration. Once the data has been read from the E57 file by our E57DataManager, it will be passed to algorithms from PCL for tasks like Iterative Closest Point (ICP) registration, feature detection, filtering, and subsampling.

In short, libe57format gets the data in and out of the files, and PCL does the complex 3D math and algorithms on that data once it's in memory. Both are necessary for the project's success.
3. Epic: Implement a Robust E57 Data Manager

Description: To create a self-contained, high-level module (E57DataManager) that handles all aspects of reading from and writing to E57 files, ensuring compliance with the ASTM E2807 standard and providing a simple interface for the rest of the application.
User Story 1: E57 File Import

    User Story: As a developer, I want to use the E57DataManager to import a complex E57 file, so that all scans and their associated point data (including XYZ, color, and intensity) are loaded into the application's internal data structures correctly and efficiently.

    Description: This involves creating a high-level manager that uses libe57format to handle the low-level parsing details. This manager will be responsible for reading the entire E57 file, including multiple scans, and translating the raw data into a usable format for the application. This story builds upon the work from Sprints 1.1 and 1.2.

    Priority: Critical

    Actions to Undertake:

        Design and implement the E57DataManager class, which will serve as the primary interface for all E57 I/O operations.

        Implement an importE57File(const QString& filePath) method within the E57DataManager.

        This method will orchestrate the use of the E57HeaderParser, E57XmlParser, and E57BinaryReader components.

        The importE57File method must handle files containing multiple Data3D sections, treating each as a distinct scan.

        For each scan, parse the point cloud data, correctly interpreting XYZ coordinates, color information (if present), and intensity values (if present). This includes applying any necessary scaling based on IntensityLimits or ColorLimits.

        Implement progress reporting for large files, emitting signals that the UI can connect to (e.g., using QProgressDialog).

        Implement robust error handling that catches exceptions from the lower-level parsers and translates them into user-friendly error messages.

    References between Files:

        E57DataManager.h/.cpp: The new high-level manager.

        E57XmlParser.h/.cpp (from Sprint 1.2): Used to parse the XML structure.

        E57BinaryReader.h/.cpp (from Sprint 1.2): Used to read binary data with CRC validation.

        PointCloudLoadManager.cpp: Will be the primary consumer of E57DataManager.

        TestE57DataManager.cpp: New unit test file for this manager.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The application can successfully load a multi-scan E57 file.

        Point data, including color and intensity, is correctly parsed and stored.

        Loading a corrupted E57 file results in a user-friendly error message, not a crash.

        A progress bar is displayed during the loading of large files.

User Story 2: E57 File Export

    User Story: As a developer, I want to use the E57DataManager to export one or more point clouds from the application into a single, compliant E57 file, so that registered data can be saved and used in other applications.

    Description: This involves adding export functionality to the E57DataManager. The manager will take the application's internal point cloud data and use libe57format's writer API to construct a valid E57 file, including the necessary XML structure and binary data.

    Priority: High

    Actions to Undertake:

        Implement an exportE57File(const QString& filePath, const QList<PointCloudData>& clouds) method within the E57DataManager.

        This method will use libE57Format's e57::Writer to construct the E57 file.

        Dynamically create the XML structure based on the provided point cloud data, including defining the correct PointRecord prototype based on available attributes (XYZ, color, intensity).

        For each point cloud, calculate and write the correct cartesianBounds, intensityLimits, and colorLimits.

        Write the point data to the binary section of the file in chunks to manage memory usage.

        Implement progress reporting for the export process.

    Files to be Modified:

        E57DataManager.h/.cpp: Add the new exportE57File method.

        TestE57DataManager.cpp: Add tests for the export functionality.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The application can export a point cloud to a valid E57 file.

        The exported file must be readable by other standard point cloud software (e.g., CloudCompare, FARO Scene).

        A round-trip test (importing an E57 file, then immediately exporting it) must produce a file with no significant data loss.

        The exported file must correctly store color and intensity data if it was present in the source point cloud.

4. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        TestE57DataManager.cpp will be created to test the E57DataManager class.

        Tests will cover importing valid single-scan and multi-scan files.

        Tests will cover importing files with and without color/intensity.

        Tests will attempt to import corrupted files to verify error handling.

        Tests will cover exporting point clouds and verifying the output file's integrity.

    Integration Tests:

        An integration test will be created to simulate the full workflow: UI -> PointCloudLoadManager -> E57DataManager -> libe57format.

        This will ensure that the new module works correctly within the application's existing architecture.

    Manual Tests:

        Manually test importing various E57 files from different sources (e.g., FARO, Leica, ReCap).

        Manually test exporting a registered point cloud and opening it in a third-party application to verify correctness.
