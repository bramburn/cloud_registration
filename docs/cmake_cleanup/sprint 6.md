# **Project Backlog: CMake Rebuild**

### **Introduction**

This document provides a detailed project backlog for Sprint 6, the final phase of the CMake rebuild initiative. With a fully functional, tested, modular, and automated build system in place, this sprint focuses on documentation, cleanup, and final handover. The primary goal is to ensure the new build system is not only robust but also easily understandable and maintainable for current and future developers. This sprint solidifies the project's engineering foundation, making it ready for ongoing development.

### **User Stories**

* **User Story 10**: Document the New Build and Development Process  
  * **Description**: As a new developer joining the project, I want clear, comprehensive documentation on how to set up my environment, configure dependencies with vcpkg, build the project, run tests, and use the new formatting and packaging tools, so that I can become productive quickly without needing direct assistance.  
  * **Goal**: To create a self-service guide that enables any developer to set up and contribute to the project efficiently.  
  * **Outcome**: A new BUILDING.md file in the repository and an updated README.md that guides developers through the entire development lifecycle.  
* **User Story 11**: Finalize and Clean Up the Repository  
  * **Description**: As a developer and maintainer of the project, I want to remove all old, temporary, and unnecessary files related to the previous build system so that the repository is clean, easy to navigate, and free of confusing clutter.  
  * **Goal**: To formalize the new build system as the single source of truth and eliminate any remnants of the old configuration.  
  * **Outcome**: A clean project repository where all build-related artifacts are current, and a finalized pull request merging the new system into the main development branch.

### **Actions to Undertake: Sprint 6 (Atomic Steps)**

This sprint is broken down into atomic tasks to ensure a meticulous and verifiable finalization process.

1. **Create Build Documentation**:  
   * **Task 1.1**: Create a new markdown file named BUILDING.md in the project root.  
   * **Task 1.2**: In BUILDING.md, add a "Prerequisites" section. Detail the required tools: CMake (version 3.16+), a C++17 compiler, and vcpkg. Include a link to the official vcpkg installation guide.  
   * **Task 1.3**: Add a "Dependency Configuration" section. Explain the purpose of the vcpkg.json file and how developers can add new libraries.  
   * **Task 1.4**: Add a "Building the Application" section with step-by-step command-line instructions for a clean build on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Emphasize the use of the \-DCMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE flag pointing to vcpkg.cmake.  
   * **Task 1.5**: Add a "Running Tests" section. Explain how to run the entire test suite using ctest \--output-on-failure and the custom run\_all\_tests target.  
   * **Task 1.6**: Add a "Code Formatting" section. Document the format and check-format CMake targets and explain their purpose.  
   * **Task 1.7**: Add a "Creating an Installer" section. Document the cpack command and explain how to generate a platform-native installer.  
2. **Update Project README**:  
   * **Task 2.1**: Edit the main README.md file.  
   * **Task 2.2**: Remove or update any outdated build instructions.  
   * **Task 2.3**: Add a prominent "Building" section that briefly explains the process and links directly to the new BUILDING.md for detailed instructions.  
3. **Final Repository Cleanup**:  
   * **Task 3.1**: Delete the CMakeLists.txt.old file from the project root.  
   * **Task 3.2**: Review the .gitignore file. Ensure that the build/ directory, vcpkg\_installed/ directory, and any other build-related artifacts are ignored.  
   * **Task 3.3**: Perform a final check of the repository for any other stray or temporary files from the refactoring process and delete them.  
4. **Merge and Finalize**:  
   * **Task 4.1**: Create a final pull request to merge the feature/cmake-rebuild branch into the main development branch.  
   * **Task 4.2**: In the pull request description, summarize the entire rebuild effort, link to the PRD, and highlight the benefits of the new system.  
   * **Task 4.3**: After the pull request is reviewed and approved, perform the merge.  
   * **Task 4.4**: Delete the feature/cmake-rebuild branch.

### **References between Files**

* README.md will now contain a direct link to BUILDING.md.  
* BUILDING.md will reference and explain the purpose and usage of CMakeLists.txt and vcpkg.json.

### **List of Files being Created/Modified**

* **File 1**: BUILDING.md (New File)  
  * **Purpose**: To provide a comprehensive guide for developers on setting up, building, testing, and packaging the application.  
  * **Contents**: Detailed, step-by-step instructions covering prerequisites, dependency management, compilation, testing, and packaging for all supported platforms.  
  * **Relationships**: Referenced by README.md.  
* **File 2**: README.md (Modified)  
  * **Purpose**: To provide a high-level project overview and direct developers to the new, detailed build documentation.  
  * **Contents**: The "Building" section will be updated to point to BUILDING.md.  
  * **Relationships**: Links to BUILDING.md.  
* **File 3**: .gitignore (Potentially Modified)  
  * **Purpose**: To ensure build artifacts and dependency manager directories are not committed to version control.  
  * **Contents**: Will be updated to include patterns like build/, vcpkg\_installed/, and \*.bak.  
  * **Relationships**: Governs the files tracked by Git.

### **Acceptance Criteria**

* **AC-1**: The BUILDING.md file is present in the project root and its content is clear, accurate, and comprehensive.  
* **AC-2**: A developer with no prior knowledge of the project can successfully set up their environment, build the application, and run all tests by following only the instructions in BUILDING.md.  
* **AC-3**: The CMakeLists.txt.old file and any other temporary build artifacts are completely removed from the repository.  
* **AC-4**: The feature/cmake-rebuild branch is successfully merged into the main branch, officially making the new build system the standard for the project.

### **Testing Plan**

* **Test Case 1**: Documentation Peer Review  
  * **Test Data**: The BUILDING.md file.  
  * **Actions**: Have a developer who was not involved in the CMake rebuild read the documentation and provide feedback on its clarity and completeness.  
  * **Expected Result**: The reviewer finds the documentation easy to follow and understands how to proceed with building the project.  
  * **Testing Tool**: Manual Review.  
* **Test Case 2**: Clean Environment Build Validation  
  * **Test Data**: A fresh clone of the repository on a clean virtual machine (or a machine that has never built the project).  
  * **Actions**: Follow the instructions in BUILDING.md **exactly** as written, from installing prerequisites to running ctest.  
  * **Expected Result**: Every step succeeds without error. The application builds and all tests pass. This is the ultimate validation of the documentation and the build system.  
  * **Testing Tool**: Virtual Machine (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware), Command Line.  
* **Test Case 3**: Final Code Cleanup Verification  
  * **Actions**: Run git status and inspect the project directory.  
  * **Expected Result**: There are no uncommitted or untracked files related to the old build system. The CMakeLists.txt.old file is gone.  
  * **Testing Tool**: Git, Command Line.

### **Assumptions and Dependencies**

* **Assumptions**:  
  * The project team has access to test the documentation and build process on all target platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS).  
  * The functionality of the application, as verified by the test suite in Sprint 3, remains correct.  
* **Dependencies**:  
  * No new software dependencies are introduced in this sprint.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

* **NFR-1 (Documentation Quality)**: The documentation must be clear, concise, accurate, and easy for a new developer to follow.  
* **NFR-2 (Maintainability)**: The final state of the repository must be clean and self-explanatory, setting a high standard for future development.

### **Conclusion**

Sprint 5 concludes the CMake rebuild project. By delivering comprehensive documentation and ensuring the repository is pristine, this sprint transforms the refactored build system into a long-term, maintainable asset for the team. The project is now equipped with a robust, automated, and well-documented engineering pipeline, ready for future feature development and growth.
