Project Backlog: Compilation Error Resolution and System Stabilization
Introduction
This backlog addresses the remaining compilation errors and system stabilization issues in the Cloud Registration C++ Qt6 project following the initial modular restructuring phase. The project has made significant progress with Core and Export modules now compiling successfully, but several critical modules still require attention to achieve full system compilation.
The primary objective is to systematically resolve all remaining compilation errors across the Parsers, Rendering, Registration, Quality, and UI modules while maintaining the established modular architecture. This includes fixing const correctness issues, resolving missing dependencies, completing type definitions, and ensuring proper inter-module communication.
This backlog builds upon the previous compilation fixes and focuses on the granular, detailed steps needed to achieve a fully compilable and stable system.
