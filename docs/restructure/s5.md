## **Sprint 5: Implement the Rendering Library \- Detailed Backlog (Updated for Current File Structure)**

### **Introduction**

This updated document details the backlog for Sprint 5, which focuses on implementing the Rendering static library. Building upon the foundational project skeleton and the Core and Algorithms libraries established in previous sprints, this phase involves physically migrating remaining rendering-related files (specifically CameraController) into src/rendering/. It also involves correctly configuring their CMake builds, updating internal and external include paths, and integrating their associated unit tests into the modular test suite.

### **User Stories**

* **User Story 1**: Migrate Rendering Logic and CameraController to Rendering Library  
  * **Description**: As a developer on the graphics team, I want to formally integrate all core OpenGL rendering logic, LOD management, GPU culling, and camera control functionality into the Rendering static library. This involves ensuring existing OpenGLRenderer, GpuCuller, and LODManager are correctly configured, and migrating CameraController into this module. This step is crucial for abstracting graphics operations and allowing for independent development of the visualization pipeline.  
  * **Actions to Undertake**:  
    1. **Physical File Migration**:  
       * **Acknowledge Existing**: Confirm that src/rendering/OpenGLRenderer.h/.cpp, src/rendering/GpuCuller.h/.cpp, and src/rendering/LODManager.h/.cpp are already present in their respective src/rendering/src/ and src/rendering/include/rendering/ subdirectories (as observed in repomix-output2.md).  
       * **Migrate CameraController**:  
         * Move src/camera/CameraController.h to src/rendering/include/rendering/CameraController.h.  
         * Move src/camera/CameraController.cpp to src/rendering/src/CameraController.cpp.  
    2. **Update src/rendering/CMakeLists.txt (File 5\)**:  
       * Modify RENDERING\_SOURCES to list all .cpp files now residing in src/rendering/src/ (relative to CMAKE\_CURRENT\_SOURCE\_DIR), including the newly moved CameraController.cpp.  
       * Modify RENDERING\_HEADERS to list all .h files now residing in src/rendering/include/rendering/ (relative to CMAKE\_CURRENT\_SOURCE\_DIR), including CameraController.h.  
       * Ensure target\_include\_directories exposes src/rendering/include/rendering/ publicly.  
       * Confirm linking to its dependencies: Core (for Octree, PointFullData, ViewportInfo, AxisAlignedBoundingBox, ScreenSpaceErrorCalculator, ProfileSection), Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui (for QVector3D, QMatrix4x4, QColor, QImage, QPainter, QOpenGLTexture), and Qt6::OpenGLWidgets (for QOpenGLWidget, QOpenGLFunctions, QOpenGLBuffer, QOpenGLShaderProgram, QOpenGLVertexArrayObject).  
    3. **Update \#include statements in Moved Rendering Files**: Review and modify all \#include directives within src/rendering/\*.cpp and src/rendering/\*.h (including the CameraController files) to:  
       * Use the new modular paths for internal Rendering headers (e.g., \#include "rendering/LODManager.h").  
       * Correctly reference Core library headers using their modular paths (e.g., \#include "core/octree.h", \#include "core/pointdata.h", \#include "core/screenspaceerror.h").  
    4. **Update \#include statements in Dependent Files (Temporarily in src/app/ / src/ root)**: Any files still residing at src/ root or in src/app/ that *depend* on these rendering files (e.g., src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp, src/mainwindow.cpp) must have their \#include directives updated to use the new modular paths (e.g., \#include "rendering/OpenGLRenderer.h", \#include "rendering/CameraController.h").  
    5. **Update src/app/CMakeLists.txt (File 7\)**:  
       * **Remove** src/camera/CameraController.cpp (if it was present) from the APP\_SOURCES variable, as it is now compiled as part of the Rendering library.  
       * Ensure the CloudRegistration executable continues to link to the Rendering library (which should already be present from Sprint 1's setup).  
    6. **Migrate Rendering Test Files**:  
       * Move tests/test\_camera\_controller.cpp to tests/rendering/test\_camera\_controller.cpp.  
       * Move tests/test\_opengl\_renderer.cpp to tests/rendering/test\_opengl\_renderer.cpp.  
       * Move tests/test\_gpuculler.cpp to tests/rendering/test\_gpuculler.cpp.  
       * Move tests/test\_rendering/test\_opengl\_init.cpp (if already in tests/rendering/, ensure its CMakeLists.txt is set up correctly).  
    7. **Create/Update tests/rendering/CMakeLists.txt (File 59\)**:  
       * Define individual test executables for each moved test file: CameraControllerTests, OpenGLRendererTests, GpuCullerTests, OpenGLInitTest.  
       * Link each test executable against Rendering, Core, GTest::gtest\_main, Qt6::Test (plus specific Qt modules needed directly in tests, e.g., Qt6::Gui, Qt6::OpenGLWidgets).  
       * Set target\_include\_directories to resolve headers correctly.  
    8. **Update Root tests/CMakeLists.txt (File 8\)**:  
       * Remove direct references to rendering test files from ALL\_TESTS.  
       * Add add\_subdirectory(tests/rendering) to include the new modular test CMakeLists.  
       * Add the newly defined test executables (CameraControllerTests, OpenGLRendererTests, GpuCullerTests, OpenGLInitTest) to the ALL\_TESTS list.  
  * **References between Files**:  
    * src/rendering/CMakeLists.txt defines the Rendering library and explicitly lists its source and header files.  
    * src/app/CMakeLists.txt links against Rendering.  
    * Files within src/rendering/src/ (e.g., OpenGLRenderer.cpp) now include their local headers (e.g., "OpenGLRenderer.h") and Core headers (e.g., "core/pointdata.h").  
    * tests/rendering/CMakeLists.txt defines tests that link against the Rendering library.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria**:  
    * All identified rendering-related C++ files, including CameraController, are physically moved to src/rendering/src/ or src/rendering/include/rendering/.  
    * The Rendering static library (rendering.a or rendering.lib) compiles successfully by running cmake \--build build \--target Rendering without warnings or errors.  
    * The main CloudRegistration application continues to compile and link successfully after Rendering library integration (cmake \--build build).  
    * All internal \#include paths within the src/rendering/ files, and in other files that depend on them, are updated to reflect the new modular structure.  
    * tests/test\_camera\_controller.cpp, tests/test\_opengl\_renderer.cpp, tests/test\_gpuculler.cpp, and tests/test\_rendering/test\_opengl\_init.cpp are moved to tests/rendering/ (or confirmed to be there) and successfully compile and run as CameraControllerTests, OpenGLRendererTests, GpuCullerTests, and OpenGLInitTest against the new Rendering library. All these tests pass.  
  * **Testing Plan**:  
    * **Test Case 1**: Standalone Rendering Library Compilation  
      * **Test Data**: The src/rendering/ directory with its current files and its updated CMakeLists.txt.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \--build build \--target Rendering from the root directory successfully builds the Rendering static library. No compilation warnings or errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake \--build.  
    * **Test Case 2**: Full Project Compilation with Rendering Library  
      * **Test Data**: The complete project structure after Sprint 5 file migrations and CMake updates.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \-B build followed by cmake \--build build (or cmake \--build build \--target CloudRegistration) successfully compiles the entire project, confirming Rendering's integration and correct dependency resolution. No new compilation or linking errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake \-B build and cmake \--build build.  
    * **Test Case 3**: Internal Include Path Resolution  
      * **Test Data**: The contents of .cpp and .h files within src/rendering/ and any other files that now include rendering/ or core/ headers.  
      * **Expected Result**: During compilation, all \#include directives correctly resolve to the new modular paths without "file not found" errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Compiler output analysis.  
    * **Test Case 4**: Rendering Unit Tests Execution  
      * **Test Data**: The compiled CameraControllerTests, OpenGLRendererTests, GpuCullerTests, OpenGLInitTest executables.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running ctest \-R CameraControllerTests, ctest \-R OpenGLRendererTests, ctest \-R GpuCullerTests, and ctest \-R OpenGLInitTest (or a combined regex) successfully executes the tests against the Rendering library, and all tests pass.  
      * **Testing Tool**: ctest.
