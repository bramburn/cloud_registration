## **Sprint 1: Project Skeleton and Build System Foundation \- Detailed Backlog (Updated for Current File Structure)**

### **Introduction**

This updated document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 1, now explicitly aligned with the **current file and folder structure** observed in the repomix-output2.md file. This sprint establishes the foundational project skeleton and initial build system, acknowledging the pre-existing deeper directory hierarchy within src/ and the current locations of files. The primary goal is to create a robust and consistent build framework that can compile without errors or warnings, even with files temporarily located at src/ root, and to prepare the CMake infrastructure for the modularization planned in subsequent sprints.

### **User Stories**

* **User Story 1**: Establish Comprehensive Build Framework  
  * **Description**: As the Tech Lead, I want to create the complete new directory structure reflecting the current codebase's organization and establish all necessary CMakeLists.txt files for the modular project. This will allow multiple teams to immediately start working in parallel on their respective modules within a consistent and functional build framework, even with files initially at src/ root awaiting migration.  
  * **Actions to Undertake**:  
    1. Create a new feature/modular-restructure Git branch to isolate this work.  
    2. **Create the Full Project Directory Structure (Reflecting Current State)**:  
       * src/  
       * src/algorithms/  
       * src/algorithms/include/algorithms/ (if it doesn't exist yet, for future headers)  
       * src/algorithms/src/ (if it doesn't exist yet, for future sources)  
       * src/analysis/  
       * src/analysis/include/analysis/  
       * src/analysis/src/  
       * src/app/ (will contain final executable source files later)

       * examples/  
       * deployment/docker/  
    3. **Create the Root CMakeLists.txt file (File 1\)**: This file will:  
       * Set cmake\_minimum\_required(VERSION 3.16).  
       * Set CMAKE\_PREFIX\_PATH for Qt6.  
       * Set CMAKE\_TOOLCHAIN\_FILE for vcpkg (manifest mode enabled).  
       * Define the project name and version.  
       * Set CMAKE\_CXX\_STANDARD 17 and CMAKE\_CXX\_STANDARD\_REQUIRED ON.  
       * Enable Qt's CMAKE\_AUTOMOC, CMAKE\_AUTORCC, CMAKE\_AUTOUIC.  
       * Configure compiler options for MSVC and GCC/Clang (warning levels, UTF-8).  
       * Set CMAKE\_RUNTIME\_OUTPUT\_DIRECTORY.  
       * Find Qt6 components (Core, Gui, Widgets, OpenGLWidgets, Test, Sql).  
       * Find Eigen3, E57Format, XercesC, and GTest.  
       * Enable testing.  
       * Use add\_subdirectory() for *all* top-level src/ and tests/ subdirectories that contain C++/CMake code (e.g., src/algorithms, src/analysis, src/app, src/camera, src/core, src/crs, src/detection, src/export, src/features, src/implementations, src/interfaces, src/optimization, src/performance, src/quality, src/registration, src/rendering, src/ui, tests).  
    4. **Create Placeholder Module CMakeLists.txt files (Files 2-X)**:  
       * **For *each* of the new src/ subdirectories identified above (e.g., src/analysis/CMakeLists.txt, src/crs/CMakeLists.txt, src/detection/CMakeLists.txt, src/export/CMakeLists.txt, src/features/CMakeLists.txt, src/implementations/CMakeLists.txt, src/interfaces/CMakeLists.txt, src/optimization/CMakeLists.txt, src/performance/CMakeLists.txt, src/quality/CMakeLists.txt, src/registration/CMakeLists.txt)**  
         * Initially, each will contain a minimal add\_library(\<module\_name\> STATIC "") command (or add\_executable for src/app).  
         * They will also define target\_include\_directories(\<module\_name\> PUBLIC $\<BUILD\_INTERFACE:${CMAKE\_CURRENT\_SOURCE\_DIR}/include/\<module\_name\>\>) if include/\<module\_name\> exists or is planned.  
         * Add a message(STATUS "Configuring \<module\_name\>...") to confirm processing.  
       * **For src/core/CMakeLists.txt (File 2\)**:  
         * Define the Core static library, initially containing project.h/.cpp, octree.h/.cpp, voxelgridfilter.h/.cpp, performance\_profiler.h/.cpp, screenspaceerror.h/.cpp, lasheadermetadata.h, loadingsettings.h **with their paths updated to reflect their intended src/core/src/ and src/core/include/core/ locations**.  
         * Link Core with Qt6::Core and Qt6::Gui.  
       * **For src/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt (File 3\)**:  
         * Define the Algorithms static library, containing ICPRegistration.h/.cpp, LeastSquaresAlignment.h/.cpp, PointToPlaneICP.h/.cpp **with their paths updated to reflect their intended src/algorithms/src/ and src/algorithms/include/algorithms/ locations**.  
         * Link Algorithms with Core, Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui, Eigen3::Eigen.  
       * **For src/parsers/CMakeLists.txt (File 4\)**:  
         * Define the Parsers static library, containing lasparser.h/.cpp, e57parserlib.h/.cpp, E57ParserCore.h/.cpp, IE57Parser.h/.cpp **with their paths updated to reflect their intended src/parsers/src/ and src/parsers/include/parsers/ locations**.  
         * Link Parsers with Core, Qt6::Core, E57Format, XercesC::XercesC.  
       * **For src/rendering/CMakeLists.txt (File 5\)**:  
         * Define the Rendering static library, containing OpenGLRenderer.h/.cpp, GpuCuller.h/.cpp, LODManager.h/.cpp, CameraController.h/.cpp **with their paths updated to reflect their intended src/rendering/src/, src/rendering/include/rendering/, src/camera/src/, src/camera/include/camera/ locations**.  
         * Link Rendering with Core, Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui, Qt6::OpenGLWidgets.  
       * **For src/ui/CMakeLists.txt (File 6\)**:  
         * Define the UI static library, containing AlignmentControlPanel.h/.cpp, ExportDialog.h/.cpp, ICPProgressWidget.h/.cpp, TargetDetectionDialog.h/.cpp, UIThemeManager.h/.cpp, UserPreferences.h/.cpp, ViewerToolbar.h/.cpp, WorkflowProgressWidget.h/.cpp. Also, explicitly include IMainView.h/.cpp and IPointCloudViewer.h/.cpp within the UI library's sources/headers, assuming they are placed in src/ui/src/ and src/ui/include/ui/.  
         * Link UI with Core, Algorithms, Parsers, Rendering, Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui, Qt6::Widgets, Qt6::Sql.  
       * **For src/app/CMakeLists.txt (File 7\)**:  
         * Define the CloudRegistration executable.  
         * **Crucially**: Initially, this executable will include **all remaining .cpp files from the root of src/** in repomix-output2.md that are *not yet part of a modular library*. This includes files like main.cpp, mainwindow.h/.cpp, MainPresenter.h/.cpp, MainViewAdapter.h/.cpp, pointcloudviewerwidget.h/.cpp, createprojectdialog.h/.cpp, lasheadermetadata.h, loadingsettings.h/.cpp, performance\_profiler.h/.cpp, project.h/.cpp, projecthubwidget.h/.cpp, projectmanager.h/.cpp, projecttreemodel.h/.cpp, recentprojectsmanager.h/.cpp, sqlitemanager.h/.cpp, scanimportdialog.h/.cpp, scanimportmanager.h/.cpp, screenspaceerror.h/.cpp, sidebarwidget.h/.cpp, voxelgridfilter.h/.cpp, IMainView.h/.cpp, IPointCloudViewer.h/.cpp, E57ParserCore.h/.cpp, e57parserlib.h/.cpp, lasparser.h/.cpp, pointdata.h.  
         * This is a temporary step to make the build pass, and these files will be migrated to their proper modules in subsequent sprints.  
         * Link CloudRegistration against Core, Algorithms, Parsers, Rendering, UI, Registration (if created) and all necessary Qt modules.  
       * **For all tests/\<module\_name\>/CMakeLists.txt directories (e.g., tests/core/CMakeLists.txt, tests/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt, tests/parsers/CMakeLists.txt, etc.)**: Initially, these will contain minimal definitions for their respective add\_executable and add\_test commands, likely referencing placeholder test files.  
    5. **Update CMakeLists.txt (Root) ALL\_TESTS and run\_all\_tests**: These will initially include very basic placeholder tests, acknowledging the discrepancy with the actual tests/ folder content.  
  * **References between Files**:  
    * /CMakeLists.txt will add\_subdirectory() to all immediate subdirectories (src/, tests/, examples/, deployment/).  
    * Each module's CMakeLists.txt will define targets (add\_library or add\_executable) and manage their specific dependencies (target\_link\_libraries, target\_include\_directories).  
    * The CloudRegistration executable in src/app/CMakeLists.txt will be the primary consumer of all modular libraries.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria**:  
    * The project skeleton can be configured using cmake \-B build from the root directory without any warnings or errors.  
    * The build process, initiated by cmake \--build build, will complete successfully, producing placeholder static library files for *all defined modules* and a compilable CloudRegistration executable.  
    * The generated directory structure, including empty include/\<module\_name\> and src/\<module\_name\> subfolders for each module, and all CMakeLists.txt files, perfectly matches the current codebase's layout and the initial architectural plan for modularization.  
  * **Testing Plan**:  
    * **Test Case 1**: CMake Configuration Verification  
      * **Test Data**: Clean Git repository reflecting the repomix-output2.md structure.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \-B build from the root directory completes with 0 errors, 0 warnings. The output should show status messages from each module's CMakeLists.txt, confirming they are all included.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake.  
    * **Test Case 2**: Initial Build System Functionality  
      * **Test Data**: The build directory created by Test Case 1\.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \--build build completes successfully. The build output should confirm that all library targets and the CloudRegistration executable are built, even if they contain minimal or placeholder code.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake \--build.

### **Final Word on Execution:**

The above updates to Sprint 1 now directly acknowledge the current (more complex) file structure provided by repomix-output2.md. This sprint will focus on:

1. **Creating the detailed directory structure.**  
2. **Updating the root CMakeLists.txt to include all top-level src/ subdirectories.**  
3. **Creating placeholder CMakeLists.txt files for all these new subdirectories.**  
4. **Refining existing CMakeLists.txt for Core, Algorithms, Parsers, Rendering, UI to reflect their intended *future* (not current) contents.**  
5. **Critically, making src/app/CMakeLists.txt temporarily compile *all unassigned .cpp/.h files currently at src/ root***. This makes the initial build pass.

**Subsequent sprints (2-8) will then involve a more targeted refactoring**:

* **Sprint 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**: Will primarily focus on **physically moving files** from src/ root into their correct modular subdirectories (src/core/, src/parsers/, src/ui/, etc.) and updating the CMakeLists.txt files of the respective modules to then use these correctly located source files.  
* **Sprint 7**: Will consolidate the truly "application-level" files into src/app/.  
* **Sprint 8**: Will move all tests/ files into their correct module test subdirectories and configure their CMakeLists.txt files.

This revised approach ensures that Sprint 1 produces a compilable, albeit initially less-than-perfectly-segregated, build. The real work of granular build segregation and include path cleansing will then be distributed across the subsequent sprints as planned.
