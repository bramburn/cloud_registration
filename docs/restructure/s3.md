## **Sprint 3: Implement the Algorithms Library \- Detailed Backlog (Updated for Current File Structure)**

### **Introduction**

This updated document details the backlog for Sprint 3, which focuses on implementing the Algorithms static library. Building upon the foundational project skeleton and the Core library established in Sprints 1 and 2, this sprint will ensure the correct compilation and integration of the core registration algorithms already residing in src/algorithms/. It involves refining their CMake configuration, updating internal include paths, and, crucially, migrating and integrating their associated unit tests into the modular test suite.

### **User Stories**

* **User Story 1**: Integrate Core Registration Algorithms into Algorithms Library  
  * **Description**: As a developer on the algorithms team, I want to formally integrate the existing core registration algorithms (ICPRegistration, LeastSquaresAlignment, PointToPlaneICP) into the self-contained Algorithms static library. This involves updating their CMake configuration, ensuring correct internal include paths, and establishing their dedicated unit tests to validate the library's functionality and its decoupling from the rest of the application.  
  * **Actions to Undertake**:  
    1. **Verify File Locations**: Confirm that the following files are already located in src/algorithms/ (as observed in repomix-output2.md):  
       * src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.h  
       * src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.cpp  
       * src/algorithms/LeastSquaresAlignment.h  
       * src/algorithms/LeastSquaresAlignment.cpp  
       * src/algorithms/PointToPlaneICP.h  
       * src/algorithms/PointToPlaneICP.cpp  
    2. **Update src/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt (File 3\)**:  
       * Modify ALGORITHMS\_SOURCES to list the .cpp files located at src/algorithms/src/ (relative to CMAKE\_CURRENT\_SOURCE\_DIR).  
       * Modify ALGORITHMS\_HEADERS to list the .h files located at src/algorithms/include/algorithms/ (relative to CMAKE\_CURRENT\_SOURCE\_DIR).  
       * Ensure target\_include\_directories exposes src/algorithms/include/algorithms/ publicly.  
       * Confirm linking to its dependencies: Core, Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui (for QVector3D, QMatrix4x4 used in PointCloud and Correspondence), and Eigen3::Eigen.  
    3. **Update \#include statements in Algorithm Files**: Review and modify all \#include directives within src/algorithms/\*.cpp and src/algorithms/\*.h to:  
       * Use the new modular paths for internal Algorithms headers (e.g., \#include "algorithms/LeastSquaresAlignment.h").  
       * Correctly reference Core library headers using their modular paths (e.g., \#include "core/pointdata.h" for PointCloud definition in ICPRegistration.h).  
    4. **Update src/app/CMakeLists.txt (File 7\)**:  
       * **Remove** src/algorithms/ICPRegistration.cpp, src/algorithms/LeastSquaresAlignment.cpp, and src/algorithms/PointToPlaneICP.cpp (if they were present) from the APP\_SOURCES variable, as they are now compiled as part of the Algorithms library.  
       * Ensure the CloudRegistration executable continues to link to the Algorithms library (which should already be present from Sprint 1's setup).  
    5. **Migrate Algorithm Test Files**:  
       * Move tests/test\_icp\_registration.cpp to tests/algorithms/test\_icp\_registration.cpp.  
       * Move tests/sprint4/test\_least\_squares\_alignment.cpp to tests/algorithms/test\_least\_squares\_alignment.cpp.  
       * Move tests/test\_point\_to\_plane\_icp.cpp to tests/algorithms/test\_point\_to\_plane\_icp.cpp.  
       * **Note**: tests/sprint4/test\_alignment\_engine.cpp and tests/sprint4/test\_error\_analysis.cpp are related to the Registration library, not Algorithms. These will be moved and configured in a later sprint (e.g., Sprint 6 for Registration).  
    6. **Create/Update tests/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt (File 25\)**:  
       * Define individual test executables for each moved test file: ICPRegistrationTests, LeastSquaresAlignmentTests, PointToPlaneICPTests.  
       * Link each test executable only against Algorithms, Core, GTest::gtest\_main, and Qt6::Test (plus specific Qt modules needed by the tests themselves, e.g., Qt6::Gui for QVector3D).  
       * Set target\_include\_directories to resolve headers correctly from src/algorithms/include/algorithms/ and src/core/include/core/.  
    7. **Update Root tests/CMakeLists.txt (File 8\)**:  
       * Remove direct references to tests/test\_icp\_registration.cpp, tests/sprint4/test\_least\_squares\_alignment.cpp, tests/test\_point\_to\_plane\_icp.cpp from the ALL\_TESTS variable.  
       * Add add\_subdirectory(tests/algorithms) to include the new modular test CMakeLists.  
       * Add the newly defined test executables (ICPRegistrationTests, LeastSquaresAlignmentTests, PointToPlaneICPTests) to the ALL\_TESTS list.  
  * **References between Files**:  
    * src/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt defines the Algorithms library and explicitly lists its source and header files.  
    * src/app/CMakeLists.txt links against Algorithms.  
    * Files within src/algorithms/src/ (e.g., ICPRegistration.cpp) now include their local headers (e.g., "ICPRegistration.h") and Core headers (e.g., "core/pointdata.h").  
    * tests/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt defines tests that link against the Algorithms library.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria**:  
    * The Algorithms static library (algorithms.a or algorithms.lib) compiles successfully by running cmake \--build build \--target Algorithms without warnings or errors.  
    * The main CloudRegistration application continues to compile and link successfully after Algorithms library integration (cmake \--build build).  
    * All internal \#include paths within the src/algorithms/ files, and in other files that depend on them (e.g., files still at src/ root or in src/app/), are updated to reflect the new modular structure.  
    * tests/test\_icp\_registration.cpp, tests/sprint4/test\_least\_squares\_alignment.cpp, and tests/test\_point\_to\_plane\_icp.cpp are moved to tests/algorithms/ and successfully compile and run as ICPRegistrationTests, LeastSquaresAlignmentTests, and PointToPlaneICPTests against the new Algorithms library. All these tests pass.  
  * **Testing Plan**:  
    * **Test Case 1**: Standalone Algorithms Library Compilation  
      * **Test Data**: The src/algorithms/ directory with its current files and its updated CMakeLists.txt.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \--build build \--target Algorithms from the root directory successfully builds the Algorithms static library. No compilation warnings or errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake \--build.  
    * **Test Case 2**: Full Project Compilation with Algorithms Library  
      * **Test Data**: The complete project structure after Sprint 3 file migrations and CMake updates.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \-B build followed by cmake \--build build (or cmake \--build build \--target CloudRegistration) successfully compiles the entire project, confirming Algorithms' integration and correct dependency resolution. No new compilation or linking errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake \-B build and cmake \--build build.  
    * **Test Case 3**: Internal Include Path Resolution  
      * **Test Data**: The contents of .cpp and .h files within src/algorithms/ and any other files that now include algorithms/ or core/ headers.  
      * **Expected Result**: During compilation, all \#include directives correctly resolve to the new modular paths without "file not found" errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Compiler output analysis.  
    * **Test Case 4**: Algorithms Unit Tests Execution  
      * **Test Data**: The compiled ICPRegistrationTests, LeastSquaresAlignmentTests, PointToPlaneICPTests executables.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running ctest \-R ICPRegistrationTests, ctest \-R LeastSquaresAlignmentTests, and ctest \-R PointToPlaneICPTests (or a combined regex) successfully executes the tests against the Algorithms library, and all tests pass.  
      * **Testing Tool**: ctest.

**Note on Scope of Algorithms Library**: This sprint specifically focuses on the Algorithms library as defined by ICPRegistration, LeastSquaresAlignment, and PointToPlaneICP. Other algorithm-like components (e.g., src/analysis/DifferenceAnalysis, src/features/FeatureExtractor, src/optimization/BundleAdjustment, and components in src/registration/) will be addressed in future sprints dedicated to their respective modular libraries (e.g., Analysis, Features, Optimization, and Registration). This ensures a focused and manageable refactoring effort per sprint.
