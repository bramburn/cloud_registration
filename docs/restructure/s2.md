## **Sprint 2: Implement the Core Library \- Detailed Backlog (Updated for Current File Structure)**

### **Introduction**

This updated document details the backlog for Sprint 2, which focuses on implementing the Core static library. Building upon the foundational project skeleton and comprehensive CMake setup established in Sprint 1, this sprint primarily involves **migrating foundational C++ files from the src/ root into the dedicated src/core/ subdirectories**. This step is crucial for achieving the initial level of decoupling and preparing the codebase for subsequent modularization efforts.

### **User Stories**

* **User Story 1**: Migrate Foundational Code to Core Library  
  * **Description**: As a developer on the core team, I want to physically move all foundational C++ files (project, octree, voxel grid, performance profiler, screen space error, LAS header metadata, loading settings) from the src/ root into the new src/core/ directories (src/core/src/ for implementations, src/core/include/core/ for public headers). This will enable the Core library to be built as a self-contained unit and serve as a stable foundation for other modules.  
  * **Actions to Undertake**:  
    1. **Physical File Migration**:  
       * Move src/project.h to src/core/include/core/project.h.  
       * Move src/project.cpp to src/core/src/project.cpp.  
       * Move src/performance\_profiler.h to src/core/include/core/performance\_profiler.h.  
       * Move src/performance\_profiler.cpp to src/core/src/performance\_profiler.cpp.  
       * Move src/octree.h to src/core/include/core/octree.h.  
       * Move src/octree.cpp to src/core/src/octree.cpp.  
       * Move src/voxelgridfilter.h to src/core/include/core/voxelgridfilter.h.  
       * Move src/voxelgridfilter.cpp to src/core/src/voxelgridfilter.cpp.  
       * Move src/screenspaceerror.h to src/core/include/core/screenspaceerror.h.  
       * Move src/screenspaceerror.cpp to src/core/src/screenspaceerror.cpp.  
       * Move src/lasheadermetadata.h to src/core/include/core/lasheadermetadata.h.  
       * Move src/loadingsettings.h to src/core/include/core/loadingsettings.h.  
       * Move src/pointdata.h to src/core/include/core/pointdata.h.  
       * **Note**: Any other files observed at src/ root that are *logically part of core* should also be moved here. (e.g., if src/ProjectStateService.h/.cpp is later deemed 'core', it would move here, but for now it's still at src/ root as per repomix-output2.md).  
    2. **Update src/core/CMakeLists.txt (File 2\)**:  
       * Modify CORE\_SOURCES to list all .cpp files just moved into src/core/src/.  
       * Modify CORE\_HEADERS to list all .h files just moved into src/core/include/core/.  
       * Ensure target\_link\_libraries(Core PUBLIC Qt6::Core Qt6::Gui) is correctly set up.  
       * Ensure target\_include\_directories exposes src/core/include/core.  
    3. **Update \#include statements in Moved Files**: Modify all \#include directives within the .cpp and .h files moved into src/core/ to use their new modular paths (e.g., \#include "core/project.h" instead of \#include "project.h").  
    4. **Update \#include statements in Dependent Files (Temporarily in src/app/ / src/ root)**: Any files still residing at src/ root (or in src/app/) that *depend* on these core files (e.g., src/lasparser.cpp, src/mainwindow.cpp, src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp, src/ui/\* files which currently include from root src/) must have their \#include directives updated to use the new modular paths (e.g., \#include "core/lasheadermetadata.h").  
    5. **Update src/app/CMakeLists.txt (File 7\)**:  
       * **Remove** all the .cpp files (project.cpp, octree.cpp, etc.) that were just moved to src/core/src/ from APP\_SOURCES.  
       * **Remove** all the .h files (project.h, octree.h, etc.) that were just moved to src/core/include/core/ from APP\_HEADERS.  
       * Ensure CloudRegistration (the app executable) continues to link Core. This is critical as Core now contains files it previously compiled directly.  
    6. **Migrate Test Files**:  
       * Move tests/test\_voxelgridfilter.cpp to tests/core/test\_voxelgridfilter.cpp.  
       * Move tests/PerformanceProfiler.cpp to tests/core/test\_performance\_profiler.cpp.  
    7. **Create/Update tests/core/CMakeLists.txt (File 9\)**:  
       * Define add\_executable() targets for VoxelGridFilterTests and PerformanceProfilerTests.  
       * Link these test executables against Core, GTest::gtest\_main, and relevant Qt modules (Qt6::Test, Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui).  
       * Set target\_include\_directories to include src/core/include/core and tests/mocks/ (if mocks are used).  
    8. **Update Root tests/CMakeLists.txt (File 8\)**: Modify ALL\_TESTS to include VoxelGridFilterTests and PerformanceProfilerTests. Add add\_subdirectory(tests/core).  
  * **References between Files**:  
    * src/core/CMakeLists.txt will explicitly list the newly moved core source and header files.  
    * src/app/CMakeLists.txt will **remove** these files from its direct compilation list and instead link against the Core library.  
    * Files like src/lasparser.cpp, src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp, src/projectmanager.cpp, src/loadingsettingsdialog.cpp, src/projecthubwidget.cpp, src/mainwindow.cpp (which currently include core headers from src/ root) must be updated to include from core/ (e.g., \#include "core/loadingsettings.h").  
    * tests/core/CMakeLists.txt will define tests that link directly against the Core library.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria**:  
    * All identified foundational C++ files are physically moved from src/ root to src/core/src/ or src/core/include/core/.  
    * The Core static library (core.a or core.lib) compiles successfully by running cmake \--build build \--target Core without warnings or errors.  
    * The main CloudRegistration application continues to compile and link successfully after Core library integration (cmake \--build build).  
    * All internal \#include paths within the moved core source files, and in other files that depend on them, are updated to reflect the new modular structure.  
    * tests/test\_voxelgridfilter.cpp and tests/PerformanceProfiler.cpp are moved to tests/core/ and successfully compile and run as VoxelGridFilterTests and PerformanceProfilerTests against the new Core library.  
  * **Testing Plan**:  
    * **Test Case 1**: Standalone Core Library Compilation  
      * **Test Data**: The new src/core/ directory with all moved files and its updated CMakeLists.txt.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \--build build \--target Core from the root directory successfully builds the Core static library. No compilation warnings or errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake \--build.  
    * **Test Case 2**: Full Project Compilation with Core Library  
      * **Test Data**: The complete project structure after Sprint 2 file migrations and CMake updates.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running cmake \-B build followed by cmake \--build build (or cmake \--build build \--target CloudRegistration) successfully compiles the entire project, confirming Core's integration and correct dependency resolution. No new compilation or linking errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Command-line cmake \-B build and cmake \--build build.  
    * **Test Case 3**: Internal Include Path Resolution  
      * **Test Data**: The contents of all .cpp files in src/core/src/ and any src/ root files that now include core/ headers.  
      * **Expected Result**: During compilation, all \#include directives correctly resolve to the new modular paths without "file not found" errors.  
      * **Testing Tool**: Compiler output analysis.  
    * **Test Case 4**: Core Unit Tests Execution  
      * **Test Data**: The compiled VoxelGridFilterTests and PerformanceProfilerTests executables.  
      * **Expected Result**: Running ctest \-R VoxelGridFilterTests and ctest \-R PerformanceProfilerTests (or ctest \--output-on-failure \-R "(VoxelGridFilterTests|PerformanceProfilerTests)") successfully executes the tests against the Core library, and all tests pass.  
      * **Testing Tool**: ctest.
