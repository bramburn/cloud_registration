Sprint 2.2 Backlog: Advanced Scan Import & SQLite Refinement
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 2.2 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. This sprint builds upon the load/unload functionalities of Sprint 2.1 and the basic scan import mechanisms. The core focus of Sprint 2.2 is to complete the scan import options by implementing the "Link to Source" feature, allowing users to reference original scan files without copying or moving them. Additionally, this sprint will involve refining the SQLite database schema for the Scans table to store comprehensive metadata and ensuring the sidebar's data model primarily uses SQLite as its source of truth for scan details.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Implement "Link to Source" Scan Import Option

        Description: As a user, when importing scan files, I want to have an option to "Link to Source," so that the application references the scan files in their original location without copying or moving them, allowing me to manage my original data storage strategy independently.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Add the "Link to Source (Keep Source)" option to the ScanImportDialog.

            Update ProjectManager / ScanImportManager to handle this import type:

                Store the absolute path to the original scan file.

                Do not perform any file copy or move operations for the scan data itself.

                Potentially copy or generate a small preview/header file into the project folder if needed for quick metadata access or previews without accessing the original large file (optional optimization, for now, assume direct linking).

            Ensure the UI clearly explains the implications of this option (e.g., project integrity depends on the original file remaining accessible at the stored path).

        References between Files:

            ScanImportDialog -> ProjectManager / ScanImportManager.

            ProjectManager / ScanImportManager -> SQLiteManager (to store scan record with original absolute path and import_type="LINKED").

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The "Link to Source" option is available and selectable in the scan import dialog.

            When chosen, no scan files are copied or moved into the project folder.

            The application stores a reference (absolute path) to the original scan file location in the SQLite Scans table.

            The import_type in the Scans table is set to "LINKED" (or similar).

            The imported scan appears in the sidebar.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Import a single scan using "Link to Source." Verify no file is copied/moved to project. Verify scan appears in sidebar. Verify SQLite record has correct absolute path and import type.

            Test Case 1.2: Import multiple scans using "Link to Source."

            Test Case 1.3: After linking, move/rename the original source file and then try to load/view the scan in the application (expect an error, to be handled more gracefully in later sprints).

    User Story 2: Refine SQLite Scans Table Schema for Comprehensive Metadata

        Description: As a developer, I need to expand the SQLite Scans table schema to store more comprehensive metadata for each scan, such as estimated point count and bounding box, so this information can be used by the application later for display or processing decisions.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Finalize the full schema for the Scans table in project_data.sqlite as per PRD section 4.5. This includes:

                scan_id (TEXT, PK)

                project_id (TEXT)

                scan_name (TEXT)

                file_path_project_relative (TEXT) - Path if copied/moved

                file_path_absolute_linked (TEXT) - Path if linked

                import_type (TEXT) - "COPIED", "MOVED", "LINKED"

                original_source_path (TEXT) - Stored if copied/moved, for reference

                point_count_estimate (INTEGER)

                bounding_box_min_x (REAL), bounding_box_min_y (REAL), bounding_box_min_z (REAL)

                bounding_box_max_x (REAL), bounding_box_max_y (REAL), bounding_box_max_z (REAL)

                date_added (TEXT)

                scan_file_last_modified (TEXT) - Timestamp of the source scan file at import

                parent_cluster_id (TEXT, FK to Clusters.cluster_id)

            Implement logic (placeholder for now) during scan import to extract/estimate point_count_estimate and bounding_box from scan file headers (e.g., for .las, .e57). For this sprint, these can be nullable or have default/dummy values if header parsing is too complex.

            Update the scan import process to populate all new fields in the Scans table for all import types (Copy, Move, Link).

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager / ScanImportManager -> SQLiteManager (to insert/update records in the enhanced Scans table).

            SQLiteManager -> project_data.sqlite (Scans table).

            Potentially, a new utility module ScanFileHeaderParser to extract metadata (optional for this sprint, can use dummy values).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The SQLite Scans table schema is updated to include all specified fields.

            When a scan is imported (any type), all relevant fields in the Scans table are populated (using dummy/default values for point count and bounding box is acceptable for this sprint if header parsing is not implemented).

            file_path_project_relative is populated for "COPIED"/"MOVED", file_path_absolute_linked for "LINKED".

            original_source_path is populated for "COPIED"/"MOVED".

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Create a new project. Use an SQLite browser to verify the Scans table has the new complete schema.

            Test Case 2.2: Import a scan using "Copy." Verify all new fields in the Scans table are populated (dummy values for header-derived data are OK). Check file_path_project_relative and original_source_path.

            Test Case 2.3: Import a scan using "Move." Verify all new fields. Check file_path_project_relative and original_source_path.

            Test Case 2.4: Import a scan using "Link." Verify all new fields. Check file_path_absolute_linked.

    User Story 3: Sidebar Data Model Reads Scan Details Primarily from SQLite

        Description: As a developer, I need to ensure the ProjectTreeModel (backing the sidebar) primarily fetches detailed scan information (like name, type, and eventually status indicators) from the SQLite database rather than relying on in-memory structures or the basic project JSON, so that the sidebar reflects the persistent state accurately.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Modify ProjectTreeModel's loading mechanism: When a project is opened, and when clusters are expanded, it should query the SQLiteManager to get the list of scans and their relevant display properties (e.g., scan_name, scan_id, import_type).

            Ensure that when a scan is added via import, the ProjectTreeModel is refreshed/updated with data that has been committed to SQLite first, or at least consistent with what will be committed.

            The project_meta.json file should primarily define the project's existence and top-level metadata, while SQLite holds the dynamic structure and detailed item metadata.

        References between Files:

            ProjectTreeModel -> SQLiteManager (for querying Scans and Clusters tables).

            ProjectManager (on project load) -> ProjectTreeModel (to initiate population from SQLite).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            On project load, the sidebar's scan items are populated based on records in the SQLite Scans table.

            The displayed scan names in the sidebar match the scan_name field from SQLite.

            Changes made to scan organization (Sprint 1.3 - moving scans between clusters) that update SQLite are correctly reflected in the sidebar upon next load or refresh.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Create a project, import several scans (using different import types), organize them into clusters. Close and reopen the project. Verify all scans appear in the correct clusters in the sidebar, with names matching SQLite.

            Test Case 3.2: Manually use an SQLite browser to change a scan_name in the Scans table. Close and reopen the project in the application. Verify the sidebar displays the updated name.

            Test Case 3.3: Manually use an SQLite browser to move a scan to a different parent_cluster_id. Close and reopen. Verify the scan appears under the new cluster in the sidebar.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 2.2 Overall)

    UI Design: Finalize any UI text or tooltips for the "Link to Source" import option in ScanImportDialog.

    Database Schema Finalization: Confirm and implement the full schema for the Scans table in SQLite, including all datatypes and constraints (e.g., NOT NULL where appropriate).

    Module Enhancement:

        Enhance ScanImportDialog to include the "Link to Source" option.

        Significantly enhance ProjectManager / ScanImportManager:

            Implement logic for "Link to Source" import.

            Implement logic to populate all new fields in the Scans SQLite table (using dummy/default values for header-derived data like point count/bbox is acceptable if full parsing is out of scope for this sprint).

            (Optional, if time permits) Begin basic header parsing for .las/.e57 to get point count/bbox.

        Enhance SQLiteManager with DDL for updating Scans table schema (if not done via migration tool) and DML for populating all new fields.

        Refactor ProjectTreeModel to ensure it primarily sources its detailed scan data from SQLite records.

    Implementation: Develop the features outlined in the user stories.

    Unit Testing:

        ScanImportManager: Test "Link to Source" logic. Test population of all new SQLite fields for each import type.

        SQLiteManager: Test schema creation/update for Scans table. Test CRUD operations with all new fields.

        (Optional) ScanFileHeaderParser: Unit tests for extracting metadata if implemented.

    Integration Testing: Test the full import flow for all three options (Copy, Move, Link), ensuring data is correctly stored in SQLite and reflected in the sidebar model.

4. References between Files

    ScanImportDialog -> ProjectManager / ScanImportManager

    ProjectManager / ScanImportManager -> SQLiteManager (to write comprehensive scan records to Scans table)

    ProjectManager / ScanImportManager -> (Optional) ScanFileHeaderParser

    ScanFileHeaderParser -> File System (to read scan file headers)

    ProjectTreeModel (on load and for item data) <- SQLiteManager (for querying Scans and Clusters tables)

    project_meta.json (provides project context, references project_data.sqlite)

    project_data.sqlite (stores detailed scan metadata in Scans table)

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    File 1: project_data.sqlite (Schema for Scans table significantly expanded)

        Purpose: To store structured data about scans, clusters, hierarchy, and future registration information for a project.

        Contents (Sprint 2.2 focus - Scans table expansion):

            Scans table:

                scan_id (TEXT, PK)

                project_id (TEXT)

                scan_name (TEXT)

                file_path_project_relative (TEXT, NULLABLE) - Path if copied/moved.

                file_path_absolute_linked (TEXT, NULLABLE) - Path if linked.

                import_type (TEXT) - "COPIED", "MOVED", "LINKED".

                original_source_path (TEXT, NULLABLE) - Original path if copied/moved.

                point_count_estimate (INTEGER, NULLABLE) - Placeholder: 0 or actual if parsed.

                bounding_box_min_x (REAL, NULLABLE), bounding_box_min_y (REAL, NULLABLE), bounding_box_min_z (REAL, NULLABLE) - Placeholder or actual.

                bounding_box_max_x (REAL, NULLABLE), bounding_box_max_y (REAL, NULLABLE), bounding_box_max_z (REAL, NULLABLE) - Placeholder or actual.

                date_added (TEXT)

                scan_file_last_modified (TEXT, NULLABLE) - Timestamp of the source file.

                parent_cluster_id (TEXT, NULLABLE, FK to Clusters.cluster_id)

        Relationships: The Scans table schema is central to this sprint.

    Code Files (Illustrative, additions/modifications):

        ScanImportDialog.h/.cpp (Modified): Add "Link to Source" option and associated UI logic.

        ProjectManager.h/.cpp / ScanImportManager.h/.cpp (Significantly Modified): Implement "Link to Source" file handling. Implement logic to gather and store all new metadata fields into SQLite for all import types.

        SQLiteManager.h/.cpp (Modified): Update DDL for Scans table (handling schema migration if necessary for existing projects from S1.2, though less likely at this early stage). Update DML to support all new fields in Scans table.

        ProjectTreeModel.h/.cpp (Modified): Ensure it fetches and can display (e.g., in tooltips or future properties pane) the more detailed scan information from SQLite.

        ScanFileHeaderParser.h/.cpp (Potentially New): A utility class to parse basic metadata like point count and bounding box from .las and .e57 file headers. (This is an optional stretch goal for this sprint; dummy values are acceptable initially).

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 2.2 Overall)

    Users can successfully import scans using all three options: "Copy to Project Folder," "Move to Project Folder," and "Link to Source."

    The SQLite Scans table is updated with a comprehensive set of metadata for each imported scan, including the correct file path (relative or absolute based on import type) and import type.

    Placeholder or actual values (if header parsing is implemented) are stored for point_count_estimate and bounding_box fields.

    The project sidebar (ProjectTreeModel) correctly sources its detailed scan information primarily from the SQLite database when displaying scan items.

    The application handles cases where linked files might be missing (basic error, more robust handling later).

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        ScanImportManager/ProjectManager:

            Test "Link to Source" logic: verify no file operations occur, correct absolute path stored.

            Test population of all new SQLite Scans table fields for "Copy", "Move", and "Link" import types.

        SQLiteManager: Test DDL for Scans table modifications. Test CRUD operations for Scans table with all new fields.

        (Optional) ScanFileHeaderParser: If implemented, test parsing of headers from sample .las and .e57 files for point count and bounding box.

    Integration Tests:

        For each import type ("Copy", "Move", "Link"): Import a scan -> Verify file system state (file copied/moved/untouched) -> Verify SQLite Scans table record is complete and accurate -> Verify sidebar reflects the imported scan.

        Test opening a project created in Sprint 1.2 (with older Scans table schema) and ensure any necessary schema migration or handling works (or document as a breaking change if migrations are not yet implemented).

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S2.2.1: Import scan using "Link to Source".

            Test Data: One .las file, one .e57 file on a separate drive/distinct path.

            Expected Result: No files copied/moved to project folder. Scans appear in sidebar. SQLite Scans table records have import_type="LINKED", file_path_absolute_linked correctly pointing to original files, and file_path_project_relative is NULL.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser, File Explorer.

        Test Case S2.2.2: Verify comprehensive metadata in SQLite for "Copy" import.

            Test Data: Import a scan using "Copy".

            Expected Result: SQLite Scans table record for the scan has all fields populated (point_count/bbox can be dummy/0). file_path_project_relative is correct, file_path_absolute_linked is NULL, original_source_path contains the original path.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S2.2.3: Verify comprehensive metadata in SQLite for "Move" import.

            Test Data: Import a scan using "Move".

            Expected Result: Similar to "Copy", but original file is gone. original_source_path contains the original path.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S2.2.4: Sidebar reflects SQLite data.

            Test Data: Project with imported scans. Manually alter a scan_name in SQLite. Re-open project.

            Expected Result: Sidebar shows the modified scan_name.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S2.2.5 (If header parsing implemented): Verify point count and bounding box.

            Test Data: Sample .las and .e57 files with known point counts/extents.

            Expected Result: point_count_estimate and bounding_box fields in SQLite are reasonably accurate.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser, CloudCompare (or similar to verify source file stats).

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint 2.1 functionalities (scan/cluster load/unload, basic view action, sidebar visual states) are completed and stable.

        The application can reliably determine absolute paths for linked files.

        If header parsing for point count/bbox is implemented, the format of .las and .e57 files will be standard enough for basic metadata extraction.

    Dependencies:

        All dependencies from previous sprints (GUI Framework, SQLite library, JSON library).

        (If header parsing implemented) Libraries or custom code for reading .las and .e57 headers.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        The "Link to Source" import option should be very fast as no file copying is involved.

        SQLite schema updates (if any for existing projects) should be efficient.

        Populating the Scans table with new fields should not significantly slow down the import process beyond any (optional) header parsing time.

    Data Integrity:

        Absolute paths for linked files must be stored accurately.

        import_type and relevant path fields must be consistent (e.g., file_path_absolute_linked only for "LINKED").

    Usability:

        The "Link to Source" option should have a clear explanation or tooltip about its implications (dependency on original file location).

    Storage:

        The SQLite database size will grow with more detailed scan metadata, but should remain manageable.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 2.2 rounds out the core scan import functionality by adding the "Link to Source" option and significantly enhances the persisted metadata for each scan by expanding the SQLite Scans table. This lays a more robust foundation for future features that will rely on this detailed scan information, such as advanced filtering, pre-registration analysis, and more intelligent data loading for visualization. Ensuring the sidebar accurately reflects this richer, database-driven information is also a key outcome.
