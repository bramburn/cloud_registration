Sprint 3.3 Backlog: UI/UX Refinements & Initial Feedback Implementation
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 3.3 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. With core functionalities for project management, scan import/organization, data persistence, and basic point cloud viewing now in place from Sprints 1.1 through 3.2, this sprint focuses on enhancing the overall user experience (UX) and user interface (UI). Key objectives include refining visual cues in the sidebar, implementing progress indicators for lengthy operations, improving existing dialogs based on initial usability assessments, adding helpful tooltips, and addressing any critical bugs or usability issues identified from internal testing of previously developed features. This sprint aims to make the application more polished, intuitive, and user-friendly.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Refine Sidebar Visual Cues and Icons

        Description: As a user, I want clearer and more aesthetically pleasing visual cues and icons in the project sidebar for scans, clusters, and their states (e.g., loaded/unloaded, locked/unlocked), so I can quickly understand the status and type of each project item at a glance.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Review existing icons and visual indicators used in the sidebar for scans (loaded/unloaded, linked/copied/moved status) and clusters (loaded/unloaded, locked/unlocked).

            Design or select an improved set of icons that are distinct, intuitive, and visually appealing. Consider platform consistency if applicable.

            Update the ProjectTreeModel and/or SidebarItemDelegate to use the new icons and visual styles.

            Ensure visual states (e.g., for missing linked files, different import types) are clearly distinguishable.

            Test the updated visuals for clarity, accessibility (e.g., color contrast), and consistency across different item types and states.

        References between Files:

            ProjectTreeModel (data roles for item type and state).

            SidebarItemDelegate (if custom drawing is used for icons/styles).

            SidebarView (displays the items).

            Icon asset files (e.g., SVG, PNG).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            New or refined icons are implemented for scans, clusters, and their various states (loaded, unloaded, locked, unlocked, missing linked file).

            The visual distinction between different item types and states is significantly improved and more intuitive.

            Icons are crisp and scale appropriately if the UI supports different DPIs or zoom levels.

            Visual cues are consistent throughout the sidebar.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Visually inspect sidebar with various project items (scans of different import types, clusters, locked/unloaded items). Verify new icons and cues are applied and clear.

            Test Case 1.2: Test with different themes (if applicable) to ensure icon visibility.

            Test Case 1.3: Gather informal feedback from team members on the clarity and appeal of the new visuals.

    User Story 2: Implement Non-Modal Progress Indicators for Long Operations

        Description: As a user, when performing time-consuming operations like importing multiple large scans or loading a large cluster into the viewer, I want to see a non-modal progress indicator (e.g., in the status bar or next to the active item), so I understand the application is working and can estimate remaining time without the UI freezing.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Identify key time-consuming operations implemented so far (e.g., batch scan import, loading multiple scans for cluster view).

            Design a non-modal progress indication mechanism (e.g., a progress bar in the application's status bar, a spinning indicator next to the processing item in the sidebar).

            Modify the backend logic for these operations (ProjectManager, PointCloudLoadManager) to emit progress signals (e.g., percentage complete, current step).

            Implement UI components to listen to these signals and display the progress.

            Ensure the main UI remains responsive and usable (not frozen) while these operations are in progress in the background (may require ensuring these operations run on a worker thread if not already).

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager, PointCloudLoadManager (emit progress signals).

            MainWindow (status bar for progress display) or SidebarItemDelegate (for item-specific indicators).

            Potentially a ProgressManager or similar utility to handle progress updates.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When importing multiple/large scan files, a non-modal progress indicator (e.g., status bar progress) is displayed showing the overall progress.

            When loading all scans in a large cluster for viewing, a similar non-modal progress indicator is shown.

            The main application UI remains responsive during these operations.

            The progress indicator accurately reflects the status of the operation and disappears upon completion or cancellation.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Import a batch of 5 large scan files. Verify progress indicator appears in status bar, updates, and UI is responsive.

            Test Case 2.2: Load a cluster containing 5 large scans into the viewer. Verify progress indicator and UI responsiveness.

            Test Case 2.3: If possible, simulate a slow operation to verify the progress indicator updates smoothly over a longer period.

            Test Case 2.4: Cancel a long operation (if cancellation is implemented as part of this or a prior sprint) and verify the progress indicator stops.

    User Story 3: Improve Project Creation and Scan Import Dialogs

        Description: As a user, I want the dialogs for creating new projects and importing scans to be more intuitive, provide better guidance, and offer clearer explanations for options, based on initial usability feedback.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Gather internal feedback (or conduct informal usability tests) on the existing "Create New Project" and "Scan Import" dialogs.

            Identify areas for improvement (e.g., clarity of labels, layout, explanation of scan import options - copy/move/link).

            Redesign/refine the UI layout of these dialogs.

            Improve instructional text, labels, and tooltips within the dialogs. For example, for "Link to Source," add a brief explanation of the dependency on the original file.

            Ensure consistent styling with the rest of the application.

            Implement the UI changes.

        References between Files:

            CreateProjectDialog.h/.cpp (UI and logic).

            ScanImportDialog.h/.cpp (UI and logic).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The "Create New Project" dialog is clear, with intuitive fields for project name and location.

            The "Scan Import" dialog clearly explains the "Copy," "Move," and "Link to Source" options, possibly with icons or brief descriptions.

            Layout of dialogs is improved for better readability and flow.

            Error messages or validation feedback within these dialogs are user-friendly.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Review and interact with the "Create New Project" dialog. Verify clarity of fields and instructions.

            Test Case 3.2: Review and interact with the "Scan Import" dialog. Verify clarity of options (Copy, Move, Link) and their explanations.

            Test Case 3.3: Test dialog responsiveness and behavior with various inputs (valid and invalid).

            Test Case 3.4: (Informal) Ask a team member unfamiliar with the dialogs to use them and provide feedback.

    User Story 4: Add Tooltips for Sidebar Items and Actions

        Description: As a user, I want to see informative tooltips when I hover over items (scans, clusters) and context menu actions in the sidebar, so I can get more details or understand the purpose of an action without needing to consult documentation.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Identify key information to display in tooltips for scan items (e.g., full file path, import type, point count estimate, date added, loaded status).

            Identify key information for cluster items (e.g., number of scans, number of sub-clusters, locked status, loaded status).

            Draft concise and informative tooltip text for common context menu actions (e.g., "Load Scan": Loads the point cloud data for this scan into memory; "Lock Cluster": Prevents changes to this cluster and its contents during registration).

            Implement tooltip display for items in the SidebarView (likely by setting the Qt::ToolTipRole in ProjectTreeModel).

            Implement tooltips for actions in the context menus.

        References between Files:

            ProjectTreeModel (providing data for Qt::ToolTipRole).

            SidebarView (displaying item tooltips and context menu action tooltips).

            SQLiteManager (as the source for detailed data like point counts, full paths).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Hovering over a scan item in the sidebar displays a tooltip with relevant details (e.g., full path, import type, # points).

            Hovering over a cluster item in the sidebar displays a tooltip with relevant details (e.g., # scans, # sub-clusters, lock status).

            Hovering over context menu actions (e.g., "Load Scan," "Delete Cluster") displays a brief explanation of the action.

            Tooltip information is accurate and dynamically reflects the item's current state.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 4.1: Hover over various scan items (copied, moved, linked, loaded, unloaded). Verify tooltip content and accuracy.

            Test Case 4.2: Hover over various cluster items (empty, with scans, with sub-clusters, locked, unlocked). Verify tooltip content and accuracy.

            Test Case 4.3: Open context menus and hover over different actions. Verify tooltip explanations appear and are helpful.

    User Story 5: Address Critical Bugs and Usability Issues from Internal Testing

        Description: As a development team member, I want to address any identified critical bugs or significant usability roadblocks from internal testing of features developed in Sprints 1.1 - 3.2, so that the application is more stable and user-friendly before moving to more complex features.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Compile a list of bugs and usability issues reported from internal testing of Sprints 1.1 - 3.2.

            Prioritize these issues based on severity and impact on core functionality.

            Allocate time within the sprint to investigate and fix the highest priority items.

            Verify fixes through re-testing.

        References between Files: This will depend on the specific bugs identified. Could involve any previously created/modified files.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A predefined list of top N critical bugs from previous sprints is resolved and verified.

            A predefined list of top M usability issues is addressed and verified.
