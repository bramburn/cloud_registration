  * **User Story:** As a user, I want to see a tree view of all my loaded scans and organize them into logical clusters so that I can manage my project effectively.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * A dedicated UI panel shows loaded scans.  
    * Users can create new empty clusters in the tree view.  
    * Users can drag and drop scans into clusters.

  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * Mouse-based controls for orbiting (rotating the view around a central point).  
    * Mouse-based controls for panning (moving the view horizontally/vertically).  
    * Mouse-wheel or similar control for zooming in and out.

    * Each viewport has independent navigation controls.  
    * Visual indicators clearly show which scan is in which viewport.  
* **Feature: Point Picking Registration**  
  * **Description:** Users can select corresponding points on two side-by-side scans to manually align them.

  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * A "pick point" tool is available in side-by-side view.  
    * Users can click on a point in the first scan's viewport and then a corresponding point in the second scan's viewport.  
    * A minimum of 3 corresponding points are required for alignment.  
    * After selecting points, the second scan is transformed to align with the first.  
    * Visual feedback (e.g., lines connecting picked points) is provided.

  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * A "select sphere" tool is available in side-by-side view.  
    * Users can click on a spherical target in the first scan's viewport and then a corresponding sphere in the second scan's viewport.  
    * A minimum of 3 corresponding spheres are required for alignment.  
    * After selecting spheres, the second scan is transformed to align with the first.  
    * The application can detect the center of the selected sphere for precise alignment.

### **3.4 Export**

* **Feature: Export Registered Data**  
  * **Description:** The ability to export the entire registered project or selected clusters/scans into a unified point cloud format.  
  * **User Story:** As a user, I want to export my registered point cloud data in E57 or RCP format so that I can use it in other CAD/BIM software.  
  * **Acceptance Criteria:**  
    * An export option is available in the UI.  
    * Users can select E57 and RCP as export formats.  
    * The exported file contains all registered scans in their correct relative positions.  
    * Export progress is indicated.

## **4\. Technical Considerations**

### **4.1 File Formats**

* **Input:** E57 (standard for point clouds), RCP (Autodesk ReCap format).  
* **Output:** E57, RCP.  
* **Parsing:** Efficient parsers for large binary point cloud data.

### **4.2 3D Rendering**

* **Performance:** Implement Level of Detail (LOD) or octree structures for efficient rendering of large datasets. Point cloud rendering should be optimized for millions of points.

### **4.3 Libraries**

* Consider existing open-source libraries for point cloud processing (e.g., PCL.js for WebGL, or C++ PCL for desktop if applicable) and linear algebra for transformations.

### **4.4 Architecture**

* Modular design to separate UI, data loading, 3D rendering, and registration logic.
