CMake Build System Enhancement and Refactoring Backlog1. IntroductionThis document outlines a detailed backlog of tasks designed to address and resolve current compilation and configuration challenges within the CMake-based build system. The primary objectives are to rectify a persistent C2065 compiler error related to an undeclared identifier, scanHeaderNode, and to modernize a legacy C++ interface. Successfully completing these tasks will enhance build stability, improve code maintainability, and align the codebase with contemporary C++ development practices. Each task is defined with clear actions, acceptance criteria, and testing strategies to ensure a systematic and verifiable resolution process.2. User StoriesUser Story 1: Resolve 'scanHeaderNode' C2065 Undeclared Identifier Error
Description: As a developer, I want the C2065 compiler error for scanHeaderNode to be fully resolved so that the project compiles cleanly, allowing for unimpeded development and testing. This error currently prevents successful compilation of one or more modules.
Actions to Undertake (Atomic Steps):

Identify Error Context:

Pinpoint the exact .cpp file(s) and line number(s) where the C2065 error for scanHeaderNode occurs.
Note the full error message provided by the compiler, as it may contain additional clues.


Verify Declaration Existence:

Search the codebase for the declaration of scanHeaderNode. This could be a variable, function, type alias, class member, or macro.
If scanHeaderNode is intended to be a type (e.g., class scanHeaderNode, struct scanHeaderNode), ensure its definition or declaration exists before its first use.1 For instance, a variable scanHeaderNode myInstance; requires scanHeaderNode to be a known type.


Check for Misspellings or Case Sensitivity:

Confirm that the usage of scanHeaderNode exactly matches its declaration in terms of spelling and capitalization. C++ is case-sensitive.1


Ensure Header Inclusion:

If scanHeaderNode is declared in a header file (e.g., scanner_utils.h), verify that this header is correctly #included in the problematic .cpp file or in a header file that the .cpp file itself includes.1
The problem might stem from headers not being self-contained. A header file should include all other headers it requires to compile independently.2 Relying on transitive includes (where A.h includes B.h, and C.cpp includes A.h expecting to get declarations from B.h) is fragile. If A.h changes and no longer includes B.h, C.cpp might fail. 3 specifically recommends that x.h should be the first include in x.cpp to test its self-sufficiency. 2 reinforces this by stating that each .cpp file is compiled as an independent unit.
Ensure that any necessary standard library headers (e.g., <iostream>, <string>, <vector>) are included if scanHeaderNode is a standard library type or relies on one (e.g., std::vector<scanHeaderNode>).4


Analyze Scope and Namespaces:

If scanHeaderNode is declared within a namespace (e.g., namespace Utils {... }), ensure it is properly qualified (e.g., Utils::scanHeaderNode) or that an appropriate using directive (e.g., using namespace Utils; or using Utils::scanHeaderNode;) is present in the correct scope.1
It is critical to avoid using namespace directives at the global scope within header files, as this can lead to name collisions and pollute the global namespace for all files that include that header.2
If scanHeaderNode is a member of a class or struct, it must be accessed using member access operators (. or ->) on an object instance, or via the class scope resolution operator (ClassName::scanHeaderNode) if it's a static member.1


Review Forward Declarations vs. Full Includes:

Determine if scanHeaderNode (if it represents a class or struct type) is only forward-declared (e.g., class scanHeaderNode;) in a context where its full definition is required. A full definition is needed, for example, to create an object of that type by value (which requires knowing its size) or to access its members.3
A C2065 error can sometimes be a secondary effect of an "incomplete type" problem. If scanHeaderNode is used where its complete definition is necessary (e.g., sizeof(scanHeaderNode), scanHeaderNode instance;, instance.member), but only a forward declaration is visible to the compiler, operations on it or its members might be flagged as using an undeclared identifier.36 notes that forward declaration renders a type "incomplete," limiting permissible operations. 3 provides an example: if class A contains an object of class B by value, b.h (the full definition of B) must be included in a.h, not just forward-declared, because A's size depends on B's size.
As a general best practice, prefer forward declarations in header files when only pointers or references to a type are needed. The full header defining the type should then be included in the corresponding .cpp file.3 This practice helps reduce compilation times and minimizes the propagation of include dependencies.


Check Precompiled Headers (PCH):

If the project utilizes precompiled headers (e.g., stdafx.h, pch.h), ensure that headers declaring scanHeaderNode (or types it depends on) are included correctly relative to the PCH. Typically, the PCH include must be the very first include in .cpp files.4 Any includes before it might be ignored by the compiler, or required includes might be expected to be within the PCH itself.


Examine CMake target_include_directories:

Verify that the CMakeLists.txt file for the target experiencing the C2065 error correctly specifies all necessary include directories using the target_include_directories command. The compiler must be informed of the paths where header files are located.
Pay close attention to the use of PUBLIC, PRIVATE, and INTERFACE keywords with target_include_directories. These keywords control how include directories propagate to dependent targets.8 An incorrect PRIVATE specification for an include directory in a library that defines scanHeaderNode (or types it relies on) could prevent downstream targets that link against this library from finding the necessary headers. 8 explains that PRIVATE limits include paths to the current target, while PUBLIC makes them available to targets that link to it. If scanHeaderNode is in LibA's public header, but the include path for that header is marked PRIVATE in LibA's CMakeLists.txt, then ExecutableB linking to LibA will not inherit this include path, potentially causing a C2065 error in ExecutableB's source files.


Clean and Rebuild:

Perform a full clean of the build directory (removing CMake cache and all build artifacts) and then rebuild the entire project. This ensures that stale object files or outdated dependency information are not causing the issue.

Acceptance Criteria:

The C2065 compiler error related to scanHeaderNode is completely eliminated from the build.
The project compiles successfully across all configured platforms and build types (Debug, Release).
No new compiler warnings or errors are introduced as a result of the fix.
The applied solution adheres to established project coding standards and best practices for header inclusion (e.g., ensuring headers are self-contained).

Testing Tool: C++ Compiler, CMake build system.






User Story 2: Refactor Legacy Interface Usage to Modern C++ Practices
Description: As a developer, I want to refactor the existing legacy C++ interface (specifics to be identified from the 'CMake Build Issues Analysis' document) to a modern C++ interface pattern, such as an abstract base class with pure virtual functions. This refactoring aims to improve code maintainability, enhance extensibility, simplify unit testing, and align the codebase with current C++ best practices.
Actions to Undertake (Atomic Steps):

Analyze Existing Legacy Interface:

Thoroughly identify the specific class(es) and header file(s) that constitute the legacy interface.
Document its current usage patterns: which classes implement it, how and where it is consumed throughout the codebase, and its overall architectural role.
If the legacy "interface" is currently an abstract class that contains non-abstract (concrete) methods, these members must be identified as they will require special handling during refactoring.9


Choose a Modern Interface Pattern:

Option A: Abstract Base Class (ABC) with Pure Virtual Functions: This is a standard C++ approach. Define a new class containing only pure virtual functions (e.g., virtual void operation() = 0;) and a virtual destructor. This clearly defines a contract for implementing classes.
Option B: Dedicated Interface Class (Extract Interface Refactoring): If the current structure is a concrete class from which an interface needs to be extracted, tools like ReSharper's "Convert Abstract Class to Interface" 9 or Visual Studio's "Extract Interface" 10 can assist. Manually, this involves creating a new class that lists only the public method signatures as pure virtual functions.
API/ABI Stability Consideration: If this interface is part of a library distributed as a binary (e.g., DLL or.so), careful consideration must be given to Application Binary Interface (ABI) stability. Directly altering C++ class definitions (e.g., adding/removing virtual functions, changing member order or types) in a shared library typically breaks ABI compatibility with pre-compiled client code.11 Exporting a C-style ABI, which is then wrapped by C++ classes, can provide greater stability.11 This is a more significant architectural decision and depends on the project's distribution model and compatibility requirements. The binary layout of C++ classes can vary significantly with compiler, version, flags, and standard library implementation, making binary distribution inherently fragile.11 If ABI stability is paramount, simply changing a C++ class definition (e.g., adding a pure virtual function) will alter the vtable layout, leading to crashes or undefined behavior for clients linked against an older version of the library unless they are also recompiled.


Define the New Interface:

Create a dedicated header file for the new interface (e.g., INewInterface.h or i_new_interface.h, following project naming conventions).
Declare the new interface class. All methods that form the public contract of the interface should be declared as pure virtual functions.
Crucially, include a public virtual destructor: virtual ~INewInterface() = default; (or {}). This ensures that derived class destructors are correctly called when an object is deleted via a pointer to the base interface, preventing resource leaks.


Update Implementing Classes:

Modify existing classes that previously implemented or conformed to the legacy interface. These classes should now publicly inherit from INewInterface (e.g., class ConcreteImplementation : public INewInterface).
Ensure that all pure virtual functions declared in INewInterface are implemented in these concrete classes. The override specifier should be used with these implementations to allow the compiler to verify that they correctly override a base class virtual function.


Refactor Consuming Code:

Update all client code that previously used the legacy interface. Pointers and references should now be to INewInterface (e.g., INewInterface* serviceProvider; or void process(INewInterface& service);).
Object instantiation will still create objects of the concrete implementing types, but these objects will be passed around or stored using INewInterface pointers or references to promote programming to the interface.
This step may require updates to factory functions, dependency injection mechanisms, or any other code responsible for creating and providing instances of the implemented interface.


Address Non-Abstract Members (from legacy abstract class):

If the original legacy interface was an abstract class containing non-abstract (concrete) methods 9, a strategy for these methods is needed:

If the logic is specific to a particular implementation, move it directly into the corresponding child (implementing) class.
If the logic is common across multiple implementations and does not depend on the specific instance's state, consider moving it to a free function, a static utility class, or providing it as a default implementation in a new base class from which concrete classes can optionally inherit (if appropriate).
Re-evaluate if these concrete methods truly belong as part of the interface contract or if they represent utility functions that should be decoupled.




Manage Header Dependencies:

Code that consumes the interface (i.e., uses INewInterface* or INewInterface&) should now include the new interface header, INewInterface.h.
Code that implements the interface will also include INewInterface.h and provide the definitions for the concrete types.
Strive to use forward declarations of INewInterface in header files wherever possible (e.g., class INewInterface;). The full INewInterface.h should only be included in .cpp files or in headers where the complete definition of the interface is strictly necessary (e.g., if a class contains an INewInterface member by value, though this is rare for interfaces).3 This minimizes build dependencies and compilation times.


Update CMake Build System:

Ensure that the new INewInterface.h and any new .cpp files (e.g., if helper classes are created or if the interface itself has a .cpp for specific reasons, though unlikely for a pure interface) are added to the appropriate CMake targets in the CMakeLists.txt files.
Adjust target_link_libraries directives if the refactoring alters module dependencies or introduces new library targets.8 For example, if INewInterface.h is placed in a new utility library.


Incremental Refactoring (if applicable):

For interfaces that are very large or have widespread usage across the codebase, consider employing an Adapter pattern temporarily. This can allow for a phased rollout of the new interface, reducing risk and allowing parts of the system to migrate incrementally.
The complexity of migrating an interface can be significant if it's deeply embedded in systems beyond simple C++ class hierarchies. For instance, in frameworks like Unreal Engine, C++ classes often parent Blueprints. Refactoring a C++ base class in such a scenario might require more than just C++ code changes; it could involve recreating or reparenting Blueprints, or using engine-specific mechanisms like core redirects to manage the transition.12 This illustrates that the refactoring strategy must account for the full context of the interface's use.




References between Files:

The header file(s) defining the legacy interface.
Source file(s) containing implementations of the legacy interface.
All header and source files of client code that consumes/uses the legacy interface.
The new INewInterface.h (and potentially an associated .cpp file if, for example, a factory for the interface is defined there).
Relevant CMakeLists.txt files for modules defining, implementing, or consuming the interface.


Acceptance Criteria:

The legacy interface is successfully and completely refactored to the new INewInterface pattern.
All classes that previously implemented the legacy interface now correctly derive from INewInterface and provide implementations for all its pure virtual functions.
All client code that previously used the legacy interface now correctly uses INewInterface pointers or references.
The project compiles successfully without errors or new warnings after the refactoring.
All existing functionality that relied on the legacy interface continues to work as expected with the new interface.
The new interface design improves code clarity, promotes loose coupling, and adheres to modern C++ principles (e.g., Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle if applicable).
Unit tests for the concrete implementations of INewInterface are either updated from existing tests or newly created, and all relevant tests pass.

Test Cases:

Test Case ID: TC_INTERFACE_REFACTOR_COMPILE_001

Test Data: The codebase after the interface refactoring has been completed.
Expected Result: Successful compilation of the entire project on all supported platforms and build configurations.
Testing Tool: C++ Compiler, CMake build system.


Test Case ID: TC_INTERFACE_REFACTOR_UNIT_002

Test Data: A comprehensive set of inputs for methods of classes that implement INewInterface, covering valid, invalid, and edge-case scenarios.
Expected Result: The methods of the implementing classes behave as specified by their contracts. Outputs match expected values. All existing unit tests for the implementing classes pass after being updated for the new interface, or newly created unit tests for these implementations pass.
Testing Tool: A C++ unit testing framework such as Google Test 13 or Qt Test 15 (if Qt is already a project dependency or deemed appropriate).


Test Case ID: TC_INTERFACE_REFACTOR_INTEGRATION_003

Test Data: System-level scenarios that involve interactions between modules or components that use the refactored interface.
Expected Result: The overall system behaves as expected. No regressions in functionality are observed in areas affected by the interface refactoring.
Testing Tool: Application runtime environment, potentially an automated integration test suite if available.






3. Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)This section consolidates the atomic "Actions to Undertake" from the user stories above, providing a master checklist. The successful resolution of the C2065 error (US1) is a prerequisite for effectively undertaking the interface refactoring (US2) if the error blocks compilation of files relevant to the interface.Debugging C2065 Error (from US1):
   Identify precise error location(s) and full compiler message.
   Verify existence and correctness of scanHeaderNode declaration.
   Check for misspellings or case-sensitivity issues.
   Ensure correct header inclusion and header self-containment.
   Verify standard library headers are included if needed.
   Analyze scope qualifiers and namespace usage (avoid using namespace in global scope of headers).
   Check class member access syntax.
   Review use of forward declarations versus full includes, checking for incomplete type issues.
   Inspect precompiled header (PCH) setup and usage.
   Validate target_include_directories in CMakeLists.txt for correct paths and propagation keywords (PUBLIC/PRIVATE/INTERFACE).
   Perform a clean build (delete CMake cache and build artifacts, then rebuild).
   Refactoring Legacy Interface (from US2):
   Analyze the existing legacy interface: identify defining files, usage patterns, and any concrete members in abstract classes.
   Choose a modern interface pattern (e.g., Abstract Base Class with pure virtuals).
   Consider API/ABI stability implications if the interface is part of a distributed binary library.
   Define the new interface (INewInterface) in a new header file, including a virtual destructor and pure virtual functions.
   Update implementing classes to inherit from INewInterface and implement its methods using override.
   Refactor consuming code to use INewInterface* or INewInterface&.
   Address any non-abstract members from the legacy interface (move to children, utilities, or re-evaluate).
   Manage header dependencies for the new interface (consumers include INewInterface.h, use forward declarations where possible).
   Update CMake build system: add new files to targets, adjust target_link_libraries if needed.
   Consider incremental refactoring (e.g., Adapter pattern) for large or widely used interfaces.
4. References between Files (Consolidated)This section outlines key files and their anticipated relationships relevant to the tasks. Specific file names will be determined during task execution.
   For C2065 Error Resolution (US1):

[module]/src/problematic_file.cpp: File(s) where the C2065 error for scanHeaderNode occurs.
[library_path]/include/actual_header_defining_scanHeaderNode.h: The header where scanHeaderNode is (or should be) declared.
[module]/include/intermediate_header.h: Any headers included by problematic_file.cpp that are expected to provide the scanHeaderNode declaration transitively.
[module]/CMakeLists.txt: CMake file for the target problematic_file.cpp belongs to.
[library_path]/CMakeLists.txt: CMake file for the library target that provides actual_header_defining_scanHeaderNode.h.


For Legacy Interface Refactoring (US2):

include/legacy/legacy_interface.h: Header file(s) defining the current legacy interface.
src/implementations/legacy_impl_A.cpp, src/implementations/legacy_impl_B.h: Files implementing the legacy interface.
src/consumers/client_code_X.cpp, include/consumers/client_header_Y.h: Files consuming the legacy interface.
include/interfaces/INewInterface.h: New header file to be created for the modern interface.
src/implementations/new_impl_A.cpp (modified legacy_impl_A.cpp): Implementations updated for INewInterface.
src/consumers/client_code_X.cpp (modified): Client code updated to use INewInterface.
CMakeLists.txt (various locations): Files to be updated to include new files, manage dependencies for the new interface definition and its implementations.


A consolidated view of these file interactions is crucial. For example, if scanHeaderNode is defined in a utility library and its target_include_directories in that library's CMakeLists.txt is not set to PUBLIC or INTERFACE, dependent targets will not automatically get the include path, leading to C2065 errors. Similarly, refactoring an interface will touch its definition, all its implementations, and all its consumers, potentially spanning multiple CMake targets.5. List of Files being Created/ModifiedThe following table provides an overview of files anticipated to be created or modified during the execution of this backlog. This list is illustrative and will be finalized as work progresses.File Path (Relative to Project Root)ActionPurpose of ChangeKey Contents/ModificationsRelationshipssrc/module_X/source_file_with_c2065_error.cppModifiedResolve C2065 error for scanHeaderNode.Add/correct #include for scanHeaderNode's declaration, qualify scanHeaderNode with namespace, or correct usage.Part of ModuleX_Lib CMake target.

The "Relationships" column highlights how changes in one file can necessitate adjustments in others, particularly concerning CMake targets and include dependencies.6. Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated)This master list defines the overall conditions of satisfaction for the entire backlog:
C2065 Error Resolution:

The C2065 compiler error for scanHeaderNode is fully resolved.
The project compiles cleanly without this error on all supported platforms/configurations.


Interface Refactoring:

The legacy interface is successfully refactored to the INewInterface pattern.
All implementing classes correctly derive from and implement INewInterface.
All client code correctly uses INewInterface pointers/references.


General:

The entire project compiles successfully without any new warnings or errors introduced by these changes.
All existing functionality, especially that related to the resolved error and the refactored interface, works as expected (no regressions).
Solutions adhere to project coding standards, C++ best practices, and header inclusion guidelines (e.g., self-contained headers, appropriate use of forward declarations).
The refactored interface improves code clarity, maintainability, and testability.
Unit tests for implementations of INewInterface are added or updated, and all relevant tests pass.
CMake build scripts are clean, correct, and efficiently manage dependencies related to these changes.


Meeting these criteria will signify that the build system is more robust and the codebase is of higher quality.7. Testing Plan (Consolidated)Overall Testing Strategy
Build Verification Tests (BVTs): Automated execution of the CMake build process (configure, generate, build) on all target platforms and configurations (Debug, Release) after each significant change. This is the first line of defense to catch compilation and linking issues.
Unit Testing:

Focused tests for individual classes and functions. Particular attention will be given to:

Logic within or around the original usage of scanHeaderNode to ensure the fix doesn't alter behavior.
All concrete implementations of the newly refactored INewInterface.


A C++ unit testing framework like Google Test 13 or Qt Test 15 (if Qt is part of the project) should be used.
CMake Integration: CMakeLists.txt files will be configured to automatically discover and register unit tests with CTest using enable_testing() and add_test() (for Google Test) or qt_add_test() (for Qt Test). This allows tests to be run via ctest or as part of the build.


Integration Testing: Tests designed to verify interactions between components, especially those that communicate via the refactored INewInterface. These tests will ensure that the system as a whole functions correctly after the changes and that no functional regressions have been introduced.

Assumptions and DependenciesAssumptions
The 'CMake Build Issues Analysis' document (provided separately) contains sufficient detail regarding the context of the scanHeaderNode C2065 error and clearly identifies the specific legacy interface targeted for refactoring.
A consistent development environment (C++ compiler version, CMake version, operating system(s), and any required SDKs) is established and available to all developers working on these tasks.
Access to the project's version control system (e.g., Git) is available for managing changes.
The project is based on a C++ standard (e.g., C++17, C++20) that adequately supports modern interface patterns (e.g., override, default for special member functions).
Dependencies
CMake Version: A minimum CMake version is required, typically 3.16 or higher for robust support of modern C++ projects and features like FetchContent or more recent Qt integration modules.16 The exact version should be consistent with project settings.
C++ Compiler: A C++ compiler (e.g., MSVC, GCC, Clang) compatible with the project's chosen C++ standard and target platforms. Compiler versions must be consistent to avoid ABI compatibility issues if precompiled libraries are shared.16
Qt6 Libraries (if applicable): If scanHeaderNode, the legacy interface, or their dependencies involve Qt, specific Qt6 modules (e.g., Qt6::Core, Qt6::Widgets, Qt6::Test if using Qt Test) will be dependencies. Correct usage of find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS... REQUIRED) and linking against Qt targets (e.g., Qt6::Core) in CMakeLists.txt is essential.8
Google Test (if chosen for unit testing):

Integration can be achieved via CMake's FetchContent module 14 or through a package manager like vcpkg.13
If using FetchContent, the CMakeLists.txt for tests will declare GTest as a dependency and make its targets available.
If using vcpkg, a vcpkg.json manifest file should declare gtest as a dependency 14, or it should be installed globally and found via the vcpkg toolchain file.
CMake will need find_package(GTest CONFIG REQUIRED) and test executables will link against GTest::gtest and GTest::gmock_main (or GTest::gtest_main and GTest::gmock).


vcpkg (if used for package management):

The CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE variable must be set to point to the scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake script from the vcpkg installation.17 This can be set via CMake command line, environment variable, or in CMakePresets.json.
Project dependencies managed by vcpkg should be listed in a vcpkg.json manifest file at the root of the project.14
The choice of vcpkg triplet (e.g., x64-windows-static, x64-windows-static-md, x64-linux) is critical as it dictates how dependencies are built (static vs. dynamic libraries, static vs. dynamic C runtime) and linked. This impacts the final binary size, portability, and deployment strategy.17 For example, x64-windows-static is suitable for single, portable executables, while x64-windows-static-md (static libraries with DLL C runtime) can be better for projects with plugins that need to share the C runtime with the main application. This choice must align with the project's overall architectural and deployment requirements.


Other Third-Party Libraries: Any other external libraries that are directly involved in the code sections affected by the C2065 error or the interface refactoring must be correctly configured in CMake (e.g., found via find_package and linked via target_link_libraries).
9. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
   Maintainability:

All code modifications and additions must strictly adhere to the project's established coding standards, including naming conventions, formatting, and commenting practices.
Header files must be self-contained, including all necessary dependencies for their own compilation, and must use include guards (#ifndef MY_HEADER_H... #endif) or #pragma once to prevent multiple inclusion issues.2
Forward declarations should be employed in header files where a full type definition is not necessary (e.g., for pointer or reference members/parameters) to reduce compilation coupling and improve build times.3
The refactored INewInterface should be clearly defined, its contract well-documented (e.g., via comments explaining the purpose of each method), and it should be straightforward for other developers to understand and implement.


Performance:

The resolution of the C2065 error and the refactoring of the legacy interface should not introduce any performance regressions, particularly in critical execution paths of the application.
If the affected code or refactored interface resides in a performance-sensitive area, performance profiling (before and after changes) may be warranted to verify this NFR.


Build Time Optimization:

Changes, especially those related to header management (such as preferring forward declarations over full includes in headers), should aim to not increase, and ideally to decrease, both incremental and full build times.6 Efficient header management is key to scalable C++ projects.


Stability & Reliability:

All fixes and refactoring efforts must be robust and thoroughly tested to ensure they do not introduce new bugs or instabilities into the system.
The comprehensive testing plan outlined earlier is critical to meeting this requirement.


ABI Stability (If Applicable):

If the refactored interface is part of a public, versioned library API that is distributed as a binary (e.g., .dll, .so) and consumed by other separately compiled modules or applications, changes must be managed with extreme care to maintain ABI compatibility. 11 emphasizes that ABI stability is not an automatic C++ feature but a deliberate design choice. If ABI stability is a requirement, the refactoring strategy for the interface must be conservative. This might involve:

Creating the new interface (INewInterface) alongside the old one, providing adapters, and planning a deprecation cycle for the legacy interface.
Using techniques like the Pimpl (Pointer to Implementation) idiom to hide private members and reduce the ABI footprint of the class.
For maximum stability across compilers and versions, consider defining the interface boundary as a C ABI, with C++ wrappers.11


Directly modifying a C++ class definition (e.g., adding/removing virtual functions, changing member data types or order) in a way that alters its memory layout or vtable structure will break ABI compatibility. Clients compiled against an older version of the library will likely crash or exhibit undefined behavior if they attempt to use a newer, ABI-incompatible version of the library without being recompiled themselves. This NFR, if active, significantly influences the permissible refactoring techniques.


10. ConclusionSummary of IntentThis backlog provides a structured and actionable plan to address critical compilation issues and to enhance the software architecture through modernization of a legacy C++ interface. The focus is on systematically resolving the scanHeaderNode C2065 error and refactoring an existing interface to align with robust, maintainable C++ design patterns. Each task is defined with specific actions, deliverables, and verification steps to ensure clarity and trackable progress.Expected Positive OutcomesSuccessfully completing the tasks outlined in this backlog is anticipated to yield several significant benefits for the project:
    Stable and Reliable Build Process: Elimination of the C2065 error will contribute to a more dependable build system, reducing developer friction and enabling continuous integration workflows.
    Improved Code Maintainability and Extensibility: The refactored interface will promote looser coupling, clearer contracts, and easier modification and extension of implementing classes. This reduces the effort required for future development and maintenance.
    Reduced Technical Debt: Addressing the compilation error and modernizing the legacy interface directly tackles sources of technical debt, leading to a healthier and more sustainable codebase.
    Enhanced Developer Productivity: Resolving build blockers and clarifying code structure through better interface design will allow developers to focus more on feature development and less on troubleshooting obscure issues or navigating complex legacy code.
    Better Adherence to C++ Best Practices: The proposed changes encourage the adoption of modern C++ idioms, proper header management, and sound interface design principles, elevating the overall quality of the software.
    Improved Testability: Well-defined interfaces are inherently easier to mock and test, facilitating more comprehensive unit testing and improving confidence in code correctness.
    By systematically addressing these items, the project will achieve a more robust foundation, paving the way for more efficient and reliable future development.
