Project Backlog: Core Component Decoupling - Sprint 4
Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sprint 4 of the Core Component Decoupling initiative. This sprint marks the final stage of the component separation phase. The primary focus will be on decoupling the SidebarWidget to complete the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture. Additionally, a comprehensive test suite for the MainPresenter will be developed to ensure its correctness and stability as the application's central UI controller.
User Stories
User Story 1: Decouple UI Logic from SidebarWidget

    Description: As a C++ developer, I want to refactor the SidebarWidget to remove all non-UI-related logic. The goal is to make the widget a "dumb" component that is only responsible for displaying the project structure and emitting signals in response to user actions. All business logic, such as handling context menu events or drag-and-drop operations, should be moved to the MainPresenter.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Analyze sidebarwidget.cpp: Perform a thorough review of the file to identify all code related to business logic. This includes the implementation of context menu actions (create, rename, delete clusters) and the handling of drag-and-drop events.

        Move Logic to MainPresenter: Relocate all identified business logic from SidebarWidget to the MainPresenter. The presenter will now be responsible for executing these actions by interacting with the appropriate backend services.

        Refactor SidebarWidget: Modify the SidebarWidget to emit signals for all user interactions. For example, when a user selects "New Cluster" from the context menu, the widget will emit a clusterCreationRequested(parentClusterId) signal.

    References between Files:

        sidebarwidget.h will emit signals that are connected to slots in MainPresenter.

        mainpresenter.cpp will implement the slots that handle the signals from SidebarWidget and will call methods on the ProjectManager to execute the requested actions.

        mainwindow.cpp will instantiate and connect the SidebarWidget and MainPresenter.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        sidebarwidget.cpp contains only UI rendering and signal-emitting logic.

        All interactions between the SidebarWidget and the rest of the application are handled through signals and slots.

        The MainPresenter successfully handles all business logic originating from the SidebarWidget.

        All sidebar-related functionality works as it did before the refactoring.

    Testing Plan:

        The unit tests for MainPresenter will be extended to cover the new logic.

        Manual end-to-end testing will be performed to verify all sidebar functionalities.

User Story 2: Finalize Presenter Integration and Testing

    Description: As a C++ developer, I want to complete the integration of the MainPresenter and create a comprehensive test suite for it. This will ensure that the MVP architecture is fully and correctly implemented, with the presenter acting as the sole mediator between the UI and the backend services.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Finalize Presenter Connections: Ensure that all UI components, including MainWindow and SidebarWidget, communicate with the backend exclusively through the MainPresenter.

        Create Test Suite: Develop a new test suite for the MainPresenter using the GTest and GMock frameworks.

        Implement Mock Objects: Create mock implementations of the IMainView, IPointCloudViewer, and any other interfaces the presenter depends on. These mocks will be used to simulate the UI and service layers in the unit tests.

        Write Test Cases: Write a comprehensive set of test cases to verify that the presenter correctly handles all UI events and interacts with the backend services as expected.

    References between Files:

        A new test file, tests/test_mainpresenter.cpp, will be created.

        New mock object files, such as tests/mocks/MockMainView.h, will be created to support the presenter's unit tests.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The MainPresenter is the single point of contact for the main UI components.

        The new test suite for the MainPresenter provides at least 80% code coverage for the presenter's logic.

        All unit tests for the presenter pass.

        The application is stable, and all features work as expected.

    Testing Plan:

        The newly created MainPresenter test suite will be the primary tool for validation.

        Manual end-to-end testing will be conducted to ensure that the fully integrated MVP architecture works correctly in a real-world scenario.

List of Files being Created

    File 1: tests/test_mainpresenter.cpp

        Purpose: To contain the unit tests for the MainPresenter class.

        Contents: A suite of test cases written using GTest and GMock that verify the presenter's logic by using mock objects for its dependencies.

        Relationships: This file will include mainpresenter.h and the new mock object headers.

    File 2: tests/mocks/MockMainView.h

        Purpose: A mock implementation of the IMainView interface for testing purposes.

        Contents: A GMock-based class that inherits from IMainView and provides mock implementations of all its pure virtual functions.

        Relationships: Used by tests/test_mainpresenter.cpp.

    File 3: tests/mocks/MockPointCloudViewer.h

        Purpose: A mock implementation of the IPointCloudViewer interface.

        Contents: A GMock-based class that inherits from IPointCloudViewer and provides mock implementations for its methods.

        Relationships: Used by tests/test_mainpresenter.cpp.

Acceptance Criteria

    All business logic from sidebarwidget.cpp has been successfully moved to MainPresenter.

    The MainPresenter is fully integrated and manages all UI interactions for the main window and sidebar.

    A comprehensive suite of unit tests for the MainPresenter is implemented and all tests pass.

    The application compiles successfully and all existing functionality remains intact and bug-free.

Testing Plan

    Test Case 1: MainPresenter Unit Test Suite

        Test Data: Mock objects for all of the presenter's dependencies.

        Expected Result: The test suite verifies that the presenter correctly handles all UI events, calls the appropriate service methods, and updates the view as expected.

        Testing Tool: GTest/GMock.

    Test Case 2: Manual End-to-End Test

        Test Data: A sample project with a variety of point cloud files.

        Expected Result: All application features, including project management, file import, and point cloud viewing, work correctly. The application should be stable and responsive.

        Testing Tool: Manual testing by the development team.

    Test Case 3: Full Regression Test

        Test Data: All automated tests from Sprints 1, 2, and 3.

        Expected Result: All existing tests must pass to ensure that the latest refactoring has not introduced any regressions.

        Testing Tool: GTest/GMock.

Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The interfaces defined in Sprint 1 are complete and will not require significant changes.

        The GTest and GMock frameworks are properly configured in the project's build system.

    Dependencies:

        The successful completion of the refactoring work from the previous sprints.

        A stable API for all backend services that the presenter will interact with.

Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance: The introduction of the fully integrated presenter should not introduce any noticeable latency in UI interactions.

    Maintainability: The new architecture should be easy to understand, with a clear separation between the view, presenter, and model. This should make it easier for new developers to contribute to the project.

Conclusion

Sprint 4 is the culmination of the component separation phase. By the end of this sprint, the core UI of the application will be fully decoupled and managed by a testable and maintainable presenter. This will not only improve the quality of the existing codebase but also establish a robust foundation for future development.
