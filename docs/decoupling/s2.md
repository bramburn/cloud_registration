Project Backlog: Core Component Decoupling - Sprint 2
Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sprint 2 of the Core Component Decoupling initiative. Building on the foundational interfaces created in Sprint 1, this sprint focuses on refactoring two key backend components: the E57 parser (e57parserlib.cpp) and the ProjectManager. The primary objective is to separate their core logic from any direct dependencies on the Qt framework, making them more modular, testable, and maintainable.
User Stories
User Story 1: Decouple E57 Parser Logic

    As a a C++ developer,

    I want to extract the core E57 file parsing logic from e57parserlib.cpp into a standalone, non-Qt-dependent module,

    So that the parsing functionality can be tested independently of the main application and reused in other contexts if necessary.

User Story 2: Refactor ProjectManager

    As a a C++ developer,

    I want to break down the monolithic ProjectManager into smaller, more focused services,

    So that each service has a single responsibility (e.g., managing recent projects, handling the active project state), improving cohesion and simplifying future modifications.

Actions to Undertake
For User Story 1:

    Analyze e57parserlib.cpp: Distinguish between the low-level E57 parsing logic (using the libE57Format library) and the Qt-specific wrapper code (e.g., QObject inheritance, signals/slots).

    Create a Core Parser Module: Design and implement a new class, E57ParserCore, that encapsulates all the direct interactions with the libE57Format library. This class should not have any Qt dependencies.

    Refactor E57ParserLib: Modify the existing E57ParserLib to act as a thin adapter. It will hold an instance of E57ParserCore, delegate the actual parsing work to it, and be responsible for emitting Qt signals based on the results.

    Write Unit Tests: Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the new E57ParserCore module to verify its functionality in isolation.

For User Story 2:

    Analyze projectmanager.cpp: Identify the different responsibilities currently handled by this class, such as managing the list of recent projects, creating new projects, and loading existing ones.

    Enhance RecentProjectsManager: Ensure that the RecentProjectsManager class, which already exists, fully encapsulates all logic related to managing the list of recently opened projects. Remove this logic from ProjectManager.

    Create ProjectStateService: Implement a new service to manage the state of the currently active project. This service will be responsible for loading, saving, and providing access to the current project's data.

    Refactor ProjectManager: Refactor the ProjectManager to become a high-level facade. It will coordinate the interactions between the RecentProjectsManager and the ProjectStateService but will not contain complex business logic itself.

References between Files

    e57parserlib.cpp will #include "E57ParserCore.h" and will delegate its parsing calls to an instance of E57ParserCore.

    E57ParserCore.h will #include "E57Format.h" and will contain the low-level parsing logic.

    projectmanager.cpp will #include "RecentProjectsManager.h" and "ProjectStateService.h". It will no longer manage the recent projects list directly.

    main.cpp (or the MainPresenter) will be updated to interact with the refactored ProjectManager facade.

List of Files being Created

    File 1: src/E57ParserCore.h

        Purpose: Header file for the new core E57 parsing class.

        Contents: Class definition for E57ParserCore, including methods for opening files, reading headers, and extracting point data. This file will be free of Qt dependencies.

        Relationships: Used by E57ParserLib.

    File 2: src/E57ParserCore.cpp

        Purpose: Implementation file for E57ParserCore.

        Contents: The detailed implementation of the E57 parsing logic.

        Relationships: Implements the class defined in E57ParserCore.h.

    File 3: src/ProjectStateService.h

        Purpose: Header file for the service that manages the active project.

        Contents: Class definition for ProjectStateService, with methods to load, save, and access the current project's data.

        Relationships: Used by ProjectManager.

    File 4: src/ProjectStateService.cpp

        Purpose: Implementation file for ProjectStateService.

        Contents: The logic for managing the active project's lifecycle.

        Relationships: Implements the class defined in ProjectStateService.h.

    File 5: tests/test_e57parsercore.cpp

        Purpose: Unit test file for the E57ParserCore module.

        Contents: A suite of GTest/GMock tests to verify the correctness of the E57 parsing logic.

        Relationships: Tests the E57ParserCore class.

Acceptance Criteria

    The core E57 parsing logic must be fully contained within the new E57ParserCore module, which must not have any Qt dependencies.

    The ProjectManager class must be successfully refactored into a facade that delegates its responsibilities to smaller, specialized services.

    The RecentProjectsManager must be the sole component responsible for managing the list of recent projects.

    The application's functionality for opening and parsing E57 files and managing projects must remain unchanged from the user's perspective.

    Unit tests for E57ParserCore must pass, demonstrating its correctness.

Testing Plan

    Test Case 1: E57ParserCore Unit Tests

        Test Data: A set of valid and intentionally malformed E57 files.

        Expected Result: The E57ParserCore class should correctly parse valid files and gracefully handle errors for invalid ones, all without relying on the Qt event loop or other Qt features.

        Testing Tool: GTest/GMock.

    Test Case 2: ProjectManager Facade Verification

        Test Data: Mock implementations of RecentProjectsManager and ProjectStateService.

        Expected Result: Unit tests will verify that calls to the ProjectManager facade correctly delegate to the appropriate backend service.

        Testing Tool: GTest/GMock.

    Test Case 3: Manual End-to-End Test

        Test Data: A collection of E57 and LAS files.

        Expected Result: A user can create a new project, open an existing one, see the recent projects list update correctly, and successfully import and view an E57 file. The application's behavior should be identical to that of Sprint 1.

        Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The functionality of the libE57Format library is well-understood.

        The responsibilities within ProjectManager can be clearly and logically separated.

    Dependencies:

        The interface definitions (IE57Parser.h, IMainView.h, etc.) from Sprint 1 are complete and stable.

        The libE57Format library is correctly linked in the build environment.

Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance: The refactoring of the E57 parser should not negatively impact file loading times. If possible, performance should be improved by separating the core parsing from the Qt-related overhead.

    Maintainability: The new, smaller modules (E57ParserCore, ProjectStateService) should be significantly easier to understand and maintain than the original monolithic classes.

Conclusion

Sprint 2 represents a significant step forward in improving the application's architecture. By decoupling the E57 parser and ProjectManager, we will make these core components more robust, testable, and easier to work with, setting a strong precedent for the refactoring of the remaining components in future sprints.
