Product Requirements Document: Decoupling C++ Components for E57 Point Cloud Processing
1. Introduction

This document outlines the plan for decoupling several key components within the E57 point cloud processing application. The goal is to improve the codebase's modularity, testability, and maintainability by applying the SOLID principles of object-oriented design. These principles encourage creating more understandable, flexible, and maintainable software. This refactoring effort will focus on the following files, which have been identified as having high coupling and complexity:

    tests/test_e57writer_lib.cpp: The test suite for the E57 writer, which is currently tightly bound to the concrete implementation.

    src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: The widget responsible for rendering point cloud data, which has business logic intertwined with its presentation logic.

    src/e57parserlib.cpp: The core library for parsing E57 files, which is directly referenced by multiple components.

    src/mainwindow.cpp: The main application window, which acts as a central hub with too many responsibilities.

    src/e57writer_lib.cpp: The core library for writing E57 files.

2. Problem Statement

The current implementation of the E57 point cloud processing application exhibits tight coupling between its components. This tight coupling makes the codebase difficult to maintain, test, and extend. A change in one component, such as a modification to the file parsing logic, can cause a ripple effect of required changes across the user interface, testing framework, and even unrelated business logic. Specifically, the following issues have been identified:

    Lack of clear separation of concerns: Components are responsible for multiple, unrelated tasks. For instance, the MainWindow class currently handles not only user interface events but also directly manages file parsing logic, making it difficult to test the parsing functionality independently of the UI.

    High dependency on concrete implementations: Components are directly dependent on other concrete classes, making it difficult to swap out implementations or test components in isolation. This rigid structure prevents us from, for example, easily substituting a different E57 parsing library or mocking the parser for testing purposes.

    Complex and monolithic classes: Some classes have grown to be very large and complex, making them difficult to understand and modify. This increases the cognitive load on developers and raises the risk of introducing bugs when making changes.

3. Goals

The primary goals of this decoupling effort are to:

    Improve modularity: Break down the codebase into smaller, more manageable components with well-defined responsibilities. This will result in a system where components can be developed, tested, and replaced independently, reducing development friction and enabling parallel workstreams.

    Enhance testability: Enable unit testing of individual components in isolation. By isolating components, we can write focused unit tests that verify specific functionality, leading to a more robust and reliable application and faster feedback cycles during development.

    Increase maintainability: Make the codebase easier to understand, modify, and extend. A well-structured, decoupled codebase is easier for new developers to understand and for existing developers to modify without introducing unintended side effects.

    Promote code reuse: Create reusable components that can be shared across different parts of the application. Decoupled components, such as the E57 parser, can be more easily reused in other projects or tools, maximizing the value of the development effort.

4. Non-Goals

This refactoring effort is strictly focused on architectural improvement and will not:

    Introduce new user-facing features: The primary focus is on improving the existing codebase's internal quality, not adding new functionality from a user's perspective.

    Change the application's overall architecture fundamentally: The goal is to refactor the existing components by applying SOLID principles, not to redesign the application from the ground up with a completely different architectural pattern.

5. Phases and Sprints

The decoupling effort will be broken down into the following phases and sprints:
Phase 1: Core Library Decoupling
Sprint 1: Decoupling e57parserlib

    Goal: Decouple the e57parserlib component from the rest of the application, making it a self-contained, testable unit.

    Tasks:

        Create an abstract interface (IE57Parser) for the E57 parser. This interface will define the contract for parsing operations, such as openFile(path), getScanCount(), and readPoints(scanIndex).

        Modify the e57parserlib to implement the new IE57Parser interface. This ensures that the existing functionality is preserved while adhering to the new contract.

        Update the rest of the application to use the IE57Parser interface instead of the concrete e57parserlib implementation. This will involve using dependency injection or a factory pattern to provide the concrete parser to classes that need it, breaking the direct compile-time dependency.

Sprint 2: Decoupling e57writer_lib

    Goal: Decouple the e57writer_lib component from the rest of the application.

    Tasks:

        Create an abstract interface (IE57Writer) for the E57 writer. This interface will define methods like createFile(path), addScan(), and writePoints(points).

        Modify the e57writer_lib to implement the new IE57Writer interface.

        Update the rest of the application to depend on the IE57Writer interface, removing direct dependencies on the concrete writer class.

Phase 2: UI and Application Logic Decoupling
Sprint 3: Decoupling pointcloudviewerwidget

    Goal: Decouple the pointcloudviewerwidget component from business logic and data sources.

    Tasks:

        Create an abstract interface (IPointCloudViewer) for the point cloud viewer. This will define methods like loadPointCloud(data) and clear().

        Modify the pointcloudviewerwidget to implement the IPointCloudViewer interface.

        Update the rest of the application to interact with the viewer through the IPointCloudViewer interface, promoting a cleaner separation between UI and application logic.

Sprint 4: Decoupling mainwindow

    Goal: Reduce the complexity of the mainwindow component by delegating responsibilities to other classes.

    Tasks:

        Create an abstract interface (IMainWindow) for the main window, exposing only the necessary functionality to other components.

        Refactor the mainwindow to delegate file parsing, writing, and viewing logic to the newly decoupled components via their interfaces. This will make the MainWindow primarily a coordinator of UI events.

        Update the application's entry point to use the IMainWindow interface where possible.

Phase 3: Testing and Validation
Sprint 5: Decoupling Tests

    Goal: Decouple the automated tests from the concrete component implementations to improve test robustness and maintainability.

    Tasks:

        Update the unit and integration tests to use the new abstract interfaces (IE57Parser, IE57Writer, etc.).

        Create mock implementations of the abstract interfaces for testing purposes. For example, when testing MainWindow, we will provide a mock implementation of the parser interface that returns predefined data, allowing us to test the main window's behavior without needing an actual E57 file.

        Ensure that all tests pass after the decoupling effort to verify that no regressions have been introduced.

6. Success Metrics

The success of this decoupling effort will be measured by the following metrics:

    Code coverage: We will aim for a code coverage of at least 80% for the decoupled components, which is a significant increase from the current state. This ensures that the new, more testable architecture is actually being tested effectively.

    Cyclomatic complexity: We will aim to reduce the cyclomatic complexity of key classes like MainWindow and e57parserlib by at least 20%, indicating a reduction in code complexity and making the code easier to understand and maintain.

    Component coupling: We will use static analysis tools to measure the coupling between components, aiming for a significant reduction in afferent (incoming) and efferent (outgoing) coupling for the refactored classes. This will be a direct measure of our success in decoupling.

    Number of bugs: A reduction in the number of regression bugs reported in the six months following the refactoring will be a key indicator of improved maintainability and stability. Fewer unexpected side effects from changes will demonstrate the value of this architectural improvement.
