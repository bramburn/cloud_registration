Project Backlog: Core Component Decoupling - Sprint 1
Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sprint 1 of the Core Component Decoupling initiative. The focus of this sprint is on establishing the foundational abstractions that will enable the separation of UI logic from business logic, as outlined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD). This two-week sprint will concentrate on creating interfaces for the main UI components and introducing a Presenter to manage their interactions.
User Stories
User Story 1: Abstract UI View

    As a a C++ developer,

    I want to interact with the main window and point cloud viewer through abstract interfaces,

    So that the core application logic is no longer directly dependent on the concrete Qt implementation, making it easier to test and maintain.

User Story 2: Introduce Presentation Layer

    As a a C++ developer,

    I want to introduce a MainPresenter component,

    So that it can mediate between the UI (via interfaces) and the backend services, creating a clear separation of concerns.

Actions to Undertake
For User Story 1:

    Analyze pointcloudviewerwidget.h and mainwindow.h: Identify all public methods and signals that constitute the essential public API for these widgets.

    Define IPointCloudViewer.h: Create a new abstract base class that declares the public API of the PointCloudViewerWidget as pure virtual functions.

    Define IMainView.h: Create a new abstract base class that declares the public API of the MainWindow as pure virtual functions.

    Refactor PointCloudViewerWidget and MainWindow: Make these classes inherit from their respective new interfaces and implement the virtual functions.

    Update MainWindow: Modify MainWindow so that it holds a pointer to IPointCloudViewer instead of a concrete PointCloudViewerWidget, interacting with the viewer only through the interface.

For User Story 2:

    Create MainPresenter.h and MainPresenter.cpp: Implement a new MainPresenter class.

    Define Presenter Responsibilities: The presenter will take dependencies on IMainView and other backend services (like the E57 parser interface) through its constructor.

    Instantiate Presenter in main.cpp: Modify the application's entry point to create an instance of the MainPresenter.

    Connect Signals and Slots: The presenter will be responsible for connecting signals from the view (e.g., a button click) to its own handler slots, thereby removing this logic from the MainWindow's constructor or UI setup code.

References between Files

    mainwindow.h will #include "IPointCloudViewer.h" and will hold a IPointCloudViewer* member instead of PointCloudViewerWidget*. It will also #include "IMainView.h" and inherit from it.

    pointcloudviewerwidget.h will #include "IPointCloudViewer.h" and inherit from it.

    MainPresenter.h will #include "IMainView.h" and "IPointCloudViewer.h" to interact with the UI components via their interfaces.

    main.cpp will #include "mainwindow.h" and "MainPresenter.h" to instantiate both and connect them.

List of Files being Created

    File 1: src/IPointCloudViewer.h

        Purpose: Defines the abstract interface for any point cloud viewer widget.

        Contents: Pure virtual functions for all public methods of PointCloudViewerWidget (e.g., loadPointCloud(), clearPointCloud(), setTopView()). It will also include the Q_OBJECT macro and declare any necessary signals.

        Relationships: Will be implemented by PointCloudViewerWidget and used by MainWindow and MainPresenter.

    File 2: src/IMainView.h

        Purpose: Defines the abstract interface for the application's main window.

        Contents: Pure virtual functions for methods that the presenter will use to update the view (e.g., displayErrorMessage(), setWindowTitle(), updateStatusBar()). It will also include the Q_OBJECT macro and declare signals for user actions (e.g., newProjectRequested()).

        Relationships: Will be implemented by MainWindow and used by MainPresenter.

    File 3: src/MainPresenter.h

        Purpose: Header file for the presenter class.

        Contents: Class definition for MainPresenter, including its constructor (which will take interface pointers), public methods, and private slots to handle UI events.

        Relationships: Depends on IMainView and IPointCloudViewer.

    File 4: src/MainPresenter.cpp

        Purpose: Implementation file for the presenter class.

        Contents: The logic for the MainPresenter's methods, including the connections between the view's signals and the presenter's slots.

        Relationships: Implements the logic defined in MainPresenter.h.

Acceptance Criteria

    The application must compile successfully after the introduction of the new interfaces and the presenter.

    MainWindow must no longer have a direct dependency on the concrete PointCloudViewerWidget class in its header file.

    The MainPresenter must be successfully instantiated in main.cpp and connect to the MainWindow.

    The application must launch and all existing UI functionality related to the viewer (e.g., changing views) must work as it did before the refactoring.

    A preliminary MainPresenter is in place, handling at least one UI action (e.g., the "Top View" button click).

Testing Plan

    Test Case 1: Compilation and Linking Verification

        Test Data: N/A

        Expected Result: The project compiles without errors, confirming that the new interfaces are correctly implemented and all dependencies are resolved.

        Testing Tool: CMake build process.

    Test Case 2: Runtime Functional Test

        Test Data: Any valid E57 or LAS file (e.g., sample/bunnyDouble.e57).

        Expected Result: The application launches, a user can open a point cloud file, and all the view manipulation buttons (Top, Left, etc.) function correctly. The behavior should be identical to the pre-refactoring state.

        Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

    Test Case 3: Unit Test for Presenter (Initial)

        Test Data: A mock implementation of IMainView and IPointCloudViewer.

        Expected Result: A unit test that verifies that when a signal is emitted from the mock view (simulating a button click), the corresponding method on the mock viewer is called by the presenter.

        Testing Tool: Google Test (GTest) and Google Mock (GMock).

Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The existing public APIs of MainWindow and PointCloudViewerWidget are stable enough to be extracted into interfaces.

        The current application behavior is well-understood and can be manually verified for regressions.

    Dependencies:

        A C++17 compliant compiler.

        Qt 6 development libraries.

        Google Test and Google Mock frameworks set up in the build environment (as per CMakeLists.txt).

Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance: The introduction of interface-based communication should not introduce any noticeable performance degradation in UI responsiveness or rendering frame rates.

    Maintainability: The new file structure should be logical and easy for developers to navigate. The separation of concerns should be clear.

Conclusion

Sprint 1 lays the critical groundwork for the entire decoupling effort. By the end of this sprint, we will have established a scalable architecture based on the Model-View-Presenter pattern, enabling us to systematically refactor the remaining components in subsequent sprints with a solid, testable foundation.
