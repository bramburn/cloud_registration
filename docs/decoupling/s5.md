Project Backlog: Core Component Decoupling - Sprint 5
Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sprint 5 of the Core Component Decoupling initiative. As the final sprint in this project, the focus will be on integration, validation, and documentation. The primary objective is to ensure that the newly refactored architecture is stable, performant, and well-documented, and that the project's success metrics have been met.
User Stories
User Story 1: Validate Application Stability and Performance

    Description: As a C++ developer, I want to perform a full, end-to-end integration test of the refactored application to ensure that all components work together seamlessly and that there are no performance regressions.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Conduct End-to-End Testing: Manually test all major user flows, including project creation, file import, point cloud visualization, and interaction with the UI.

        Resolve Integration Issues: Identify and fix any bugs or unexpected behaviors that arise from the interaction between the newly decoupled components.

        Perform Performance Benchmarking: Measure the application's performance against the benchmarks established before the refactoring to ensure that there are no new performance bottlenecks.

    References between Files: This user story involves the interaction of all refactored components, including the MainPresenter, IMainView, IPointCloudViewer, SidebarWidget, ProjectManager, and E57ParserLib.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        All major user flows are fully functional and free of bugs.

        The application is stable and does not crash or exhibit unexpected behavior during testing.

        Performance metrics (e.g., file loading time, UI responsiveness) are equal to or better than the pre-refactoring benchmarks.

    Testing Plan:

        Manual end-to-end testing of all application features.

        Automated performance tests to measure key metrics.

User Story 2: Finalize Documentation and Test Suite

    Description: As a C++ developer, I want to finalize the developer documentation and the automated test suite to ensure that the new architecture is easy to understand, maintain, and extend in the future.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Update Developer Documentation: Revise the existing developer documentation to reflect the new MVP architecture, including diagrams and descriptions of the new components and their interactions.

        Complete Test Coverage: Review the automated test suite to ensure that all new, decoupled components have adequate test coverage. Add any missing unit or integration tests.

        Document Success Metrics: Measure and document the final success metrics for the project, including the reduction in lines of code (LOC), the improvement in code complexity, and the final unit test coverage percentages.

    References between Files: This user story will result in the creation and modification of documentation files (e.g., docs/architecture.md) and test files (e.g., tests/test_mainpresenter.cpp).

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The developer documentation is up-to-date and accurately reflects the new architecture.

        The automated test suite provides at least 80% code coverage for all new components.

        A final report documenting the project's success metrics is produced.

    Testing Plan:

        The completeness and accuracy of the documentation will be reviewed by the development team.

        The code coverage of the test suite will be measured using a code coverage tool.

List of Files being Created

    File 1: docs/Architecture.md

        Purpose: To provide a comprehensive overview of the new, decoupled MVP architecture.

        Contents: This document will include diagrams and detailed descriptions of the main components (Model, View, Presenter) and their interactions. It will also provide guidance on how to extend the application with new features in the future.

        Relationships: This file will reference all the major components of the application.

    File 2: docs/Project_Success_Metrics.md

        Purpose: To document the final success metrics of the decoupling initiative.

        Contents: This document will present a quantitative analysis of the project's outcomes, including the final LOC reduction, code complexity scores, and unit test coverage percentages.

        Relationships: This file will reference the source code files that were refactored.

    File 3: tests/test_integration.cpp

        Purpose: To contain integration tests that verify the correct interaction between the major components of the application.

        Contents: A suite of test cases that simulate user workflows and ensure that the presenter, view, and model components work together as expected.

        Relationships: This file will include the headers for the presenter and the mock implementations of the view and model.

Testing Plan

    Test Case 1: Full End-to-End Manual Test

        Test Data: A diverse set of sample projects and point cloud files.

        Expected Result: All application features are tested and verified to work correctly. The application is stable and performs well under a variety of conditions.

        Testing Tool: Manual testing by the development team.

    Test Case 2: Automated Regression Suite

        Test Data: All existing automated tests from Sprints 1-4.

        Expected Result: All tests pass, ensuring that no regressions have been introduced in the final phase of the project.

        Testing Tool: GTest/GMock.

    Test Case 3: Performance Benchmark Test

        Test Data: A large point cloud file.

        Expected Result: The time taken to load and render the file is measured and compared against the pre-refactoring benchmark. The performance should be equal or better.

        Testing Tool: A custom performance testing script or manual timing.

Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The refactoring work from the previous sprints is complete and stable.

        No new features or major changes will be introduced during this final sprint.

    Dependencies:

        A fully configured testing environment with access to all necessary tools and test data.

        The availability of the development team for manual testing and documentation review.

Non-Functional Requirements

    Stability: The final application must be stable and free of any critical bugs or memory leaks.

    Documentation: The project's documentation must be clear, concise, and comprehensive enough to enable new developers to quickly understand the codebase.

Conclusion

Sprint 5 is the final and most critical phase of the Core Component Decoupling project. By focusing on thorough integration testing, performance validation, and comprehensive documentation, we will ensure that the refactored application is not only more maintainable and testable but also robust and reliable. The successful completion of this sprint will mark a significant improvement in the quality of the codebase and will provide a solid foundation for the future development of the application.
