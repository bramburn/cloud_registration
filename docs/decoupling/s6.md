Project Backlog: Sprint 6 - Documentation, Cleanup, and Final Reporting
Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 6, the concluding phase of the application's architectural refactoring initiative. With the core components now successfully decoupled and the test suite updated, this final sprint is dedicated to ensuring the long-term maintainability and understandability of the codebase. The focus will be on creating comprehensive documentation, performing a final code cleanup, and producing a detailed report to summarize the project's outcomes, achievements, and lessons learned.
User Stories

    User Story 6.1: Update Developer Documentation

        As a new developer joining the team, I want to have clear and up-to-date documentation on the application's architecture and coding standards so that I can quickly understand the codebase and contribute effectively.

        Description: This story involves creating and updating key documentation artifacts to reflect the new, decoupled architecture. This includes a high-level overview of the system design, detailed documentation for the new abstract interfaces, and guidelines for contributing to the project.
    User Story 6.2: Finalize and Clean Up the Codebase

        As a developer, I want to perform a final pass on the codebase to remove obsolete code, fix minor issues, and ensure consistent formatting so that the project is left in a clean, professional, and maintainable state.

        Description: This story addresses the technical debt that may have accumulated during the refactoring process. It involves a thorough code review to identify and remove any dead code, commented-out blocks, and temporary solutions. It also includes standardizing code formatting and ensuring all compiler warnings are resolved.
    User Story 6.3: Create a Final Project Report

        As a project manager, I want a comprehensive final report that summarizes the entire decoupling initiative so that I can assess the project's success against its original goals and share the outcomes with stakeholders.

        Description: This story involves gathering and analyzing the metrics defined in the project's PRD (e.g., code coverage, cyclomatic complexity) to create a final report. This report will detail the "before and after" state of the codebase, summarize the achievements of each sprint, and document key lessons learned for future projects.

Actions to Undertake

    For User Story 6.1 (Documentation):

        Create ARCHITECTURE.md: Write a new markdown file that provides a high-level overview of the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) architecture. Include diagrams illustrating the relationships between the View (MainWindow), Presenter (MainPresenter), and Model (services like IE57Parser).

        Document Interfaces: Add detailed Doxygen-style comments to the interface files (IE57Parser.h, IE57Writer.h, IPointCloudViewer.h, IMainView.h) explaining the purpose of each method.

        Update README.md: Revise the main project README.md to include a section on the new architecture and a guide on how to build and run the refactored test suite.

        Create CONTRIBUTING.md: Establish guidelines for future development, explaining how to add new features within the decoupled architecture and how to write tests using the mock objects.

    For User Story 6.2 (Cleanup):

        Code Review: Conduct a peer review of all refactored components.

        Remove Obsolete Code: Search for and delete any commented-out code blocks that are no longer relevant. Remove any temporary or legacy files that were created during the refactoring sprints.

        Standardize Formatting: Run a code formatter (e.g., Clang-Format) across the entire codebase to ensure consistent style.

        Address Compiler Warnings: Compile the project with the highest warning level (-W4 or /W4) and resolve all reported warnings.

    For User Story 6.3 (Final Report):

        Gather Metrics: Collect the "before" and "after" metrics for code coverage, cyclomatic complexity, and component coupling.

        Write Sprint Summaries: Briefly summarize the goals and outcomes of each of the five preceding sprints.

        Document Lessons Learned: Hold a team retrospective to identify what went well, what could be improved, and key takeaways from the project.

        Assemble Final Report: Combine all the above information into a single, well-structured Final_Report.md document.

References between Files

    ARCHITECTURE.md (New): Will reference the source code files for IMainView, MainPresenter, IE57Parser, IPointCloudViewer, etc., to explain their roles.

    README.md (Modified): Will link to ARCHITECTURE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md.

    Final_Report.md (New): Will reference data from code coverage reports, static analysis tools, and the project's version control history.

List of Files being Created

    File 1: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

        Purpose: To provide a clear, high-level guide to the new application architecture for current and future developers.

        Contents: Text and diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid.js syntax) explaining the MVP pattern, the roles of the interfaces, and the data flow for key operations like opening a file.

        Relationships: Describes the relationships between MainWindow, MainPresenter, IE57Parser, and other core components.
    File 2: CONTRIBUTING.md

        Purpose: To standardize the process for contributing to the project, ensuring that new code adheres to the decoupled design.

        Contents: Guidelines on coding style, branching strategy, and the process for adding new features (e.g., "all business logic must be in a presenter").

        Relationships: References the new interfaces and mock classes as tools for development and testing.
    File 3: reports/Final_Report.md

        Purpose: To formally document the outcome of the entire refactoring project for stakeholders.

        Contents: An executive summary, a comparison of before-and-after metrics, a summary of work completed in each sprint, and a section on lessons learned.

        Relationships: This document is a meta-artifact that analyzes the entire project.

Acceptance Criteria

    A document explaining the new architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md) is created and has been peer-reviewed for clarity and accuracy.

    The README.md is updated to reflect the current state of the project.

    The codebase is free of commented-out, obsolete code and compiles without any warnings on the highest warning level.

    A final report (Final_Report.md) is produced, containing quantitative data (e.g., code coverage increased from X% to Y%) that demonstrates the success of the project against its initial goals.

    A final, full regression test of the application's user-facing features passes, ensuring no functionality was lost during the cleanup phase.

Testing Plan

    Test Case 1: Documentation Peer Review

        Description: Have at least one other developer review the new ARCHITECTURE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files.

        Test Data: The documentation files themselves.

        Expected Result: The reviewer confirms that the documentation is clear, accurate, and sufficient for a new developer to understand the project structure.

        Testing Tool: Manual review, pull request comments.
    Test Case 2: Final Regression Test

        Description: Perform a full manual test of all major application features after the final code cleanup.

        Test Data: A mix of valid E57 and LAS files.

        Expected Result: The application should function perfectly, with all features (project creation, file import, 3D navigation, etc.) working as expected. No new bugs should have been introduced.

        Testing Tool: Manual execution.
    Test Case 3: Final Report Validation

        Description: The project manager and lead developer review the Final_Report.md.

        Test Data: The final report document.

        Expected Result: The report is deemed a complete and accurate summary of the project, and all required metrics are present and correctly interpreted.

        Testing Tool: Manual review.

Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The metrics required for the final report (e.g., code coverage) can be successfully generated from the codebase.

        No major bugs or architectural issues were missed in the previous sprints that would require significant refactoring in this final phase.

    Dependencies:

        This sprint is entirely dependent on the successful completion of Sprints 1 through 5. It cannot begin until the application has been fully refactored and the test suite updated.

Non-Functional Requirements

    Maintainability: The primary NFR for this sprint is to deliver a codebase and documentation set that is highly maintainable for the foreseeable future. The success of this will be judged by how easily a new developer can understand and contribute to the project using the new documentation.

    Clarity: All documentation must be written in clear, concise language, avoiding jargon where possible and providing diagrams to aid understanding.

Conclusion

Sprint 6 is the capstone of the decoupling initiative. It transforms the ad-hoc knowledge gained during the refactoring process into permanent, accessible documentation and a polished final product. By completing the tasks in this backlog, the team will ensure that the benefits of the new architecture—modularity, testability, and maintainability—are preserved and easily leveraged for all future development on the application.
