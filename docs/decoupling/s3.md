Project Backlog: Core Component Decoupling - Sprint 3
Introduction

This document provides a detailed backlog for Sprint 3 of the Core Component Decoupling initiative. Following the successful refactoring of the backend components in Sprint 2, this sprint will focus on the UI layer. The primary objective is to decouple the business logic from the SidebarWidget and fully integrate the MainPresenter as the central controller for UI interactions, thereby completing the Model-View-Presenter (MVP) implementation for the main application window.
User Stories
User Story 1: Decouple SidebarWidget Logic

    As a a C++ developer,

    I want to extract the business and interaction logic from sidebarwidget.cpp,

    So that the widget is only responsible for displaying data and emitting signals, with all complex logic handled by the presenter.

User Story 2: Finalize Presenter Integration

    As a a C++ developer,

    I want to complete the integration of the MainPresenter,

    So that it acts as the single, cohesive controller that manages all interactions between the main UI components and the backend services.

Actions to Undertake
For User Story 1:

    Analyze sidebarwidget.cpp: Carefully review the existing implementation to identify all logic that is not strictly related to UI rendering. This includes handling context menu actions, processing drag-and-drop events, and managing the state of the tree view.

    Move Logic to MainPresenter: Relocate the identified business logic to the MainPresenter. For example, the logic for creating, renaming, and deleting clusters will be moved to the presenter, which will then call the appropriate backend service.

    Refactor SidebarWidget: Simplify the SidebarWidget so that it becomes a "dumb" component. It should only be responsible for displaying the project structure (as dictated by the presenter) and emitting signals (e.g., clusterCreationRequested, scanDroppedOnCluster) in response to user input.

For User Story 2:

    Connect Sidebar to Presenter: Establish a clear and complete set of signal-slot connections between the SidebarWidget and the MainPresenter. For instance, the sidebarWidget->clusterCreationRequested(parentClusterId) signal will be connected to the mainPresenter->onCreateCluster(parentClusterId) slot.

    Centralize State Management: Ensure that all UI state changes are driven by the presenter. For example, when a new cluster is created, the presenter will update the backend model and then instruct the SidebarWidget to add a new node to the tree view.

    End-to-End Integration: Verify that the entire workflow, from a user clicking a button in the UI to the backend service executing the action and the UI updating in response, is managed by the presenter.

References between Files

    sidebarwidget.h will no longer directly interact with the ProjectManager. Instead, it will emit signals that the MainPresenter will handle.

    mainpresenter.cpp will #include "sidebarwidget.h" (or its interface if one is created) and will connect to its signals. It will also #include "projectmanager.h" and call its methods in response to UI events.

    mainwindow.cpp will ensure that both the SidebarWidget and MainPresenter are correctly instantiated and connected.

List of Files being Created

For this sprint, the focus is primarily on refactoring existing files rather than creating new ones. The following files will be significantly modified:

    src/sidebarwidget.h and src/sidebarwidget.cpp

    src/mainpresenter.h and src/mainpresenter.cpp

    src/mainwindow.h and src/mainwindow.cpp

No new production code files are expected to be created. However, new unit test files may be added for the presenter's new responsibilities.
Acceptance Criteria

    All non-UI logic must be removed from sidebarwidget.cpp and relocated to the MainPresenter.

    The SidebarWidget must communicate with the rest of the application exclusively through signals and slots.

    The MainPresenter must handle all user interactions originating from the SidebarWidget, such as creating, renaming, and deleting clusters.

    The application's functionality related to the project sidebar (e.g., creating clusters, moving scans) must remain fully intact and behave identically to the pre-refactoring version.

    Unit tests for the MainPresenter must be expanded to cover the new logic migrated from the SidebarWidget.

Testing Plan

    Test Case 1: Presenter Logic Unit Tests

        Test Data: Mock implementations of the SidebarWidget and ProjectManager.

        Expected Result: When the mock sidebar emits a signal (e.g., clusterCreationRequested), the presenter should call the corresponding method on the mock ProjectManager. The tests will verify that the correct parameters are passed and the UI is updated appropriately based on the outcome.

        Testing Tool: GTest/GMock.

    Test Case 2: Manual End-to-End Test for Sidebar Functionality

        Test Data: A sample project with several E57 and LAS files.

        Expected Result: A user can perform all actions available in the sidebar's context menu (e.g., create, rename, delete clusters; move scans) and the application behaves as expected. The tree view should update correctly after each action.

        Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

    Test Case 3: Regression Testing

        Test Data: The full suite of tests from Sprints 1 and 2.

        Expected Result: All previous tests must continue to pass, ensuring that the current refactoring has not introduced any regressions in the backend services or the main window's functionality.

        Testing Tool: GTest/GMock and manual testing.

Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The MainPresenter and the UI interfaces (IMainView, IPointCloudViewer) established in Sprint 1 are sufficiently robust to handle the additional responsibilities.

        The backend services, particularly ProjectManager, have a clear and stable API for the presenter to interact with.

    Dependencies:

        The successful completion of the refactoring work from Sprints 1 and 2 is essential.

        The existing functionality of the SidebarWidget is well-defined and can be replicated in the presenter.

Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance: The interaction latency for UI elements in the sidebar should not increase. Actions like creating a new cluster should feel instantaneous.

    Code Readability: The new, simplified SidebarWidget class should be significantly easier to read and understand than its previous monolithic version. The presenter should have a clear, logical structure for handling UI events.

Conclusion

Sprint 3 marks a pivotal point in this refactoring initiative. By completing the decoupling of the SidebarWidget and solidifying the role of the MainPresenter, we will have a fully implemented MVP architecture for the application's primary user interface. This will not only improve the current state of the codebase but also provide a clear and scalable pattern for developing new UI features in the future.
