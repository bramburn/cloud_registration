- **Status**: COMPLETE
- **Review Results**:
  - ✅ docs/ directory contains general project documentation
  - ✅ docs/sprints/ contains all sprint-specific documentation
  - ✅ Documentation content is accurate and relevant
  - ✅ Consistent Markdown formatting across all files
  - ✅ No critical documentation missing or outdated

## Tools and Verification

### Verification Script
- Created and executed `scripts/tests/verify_sprint2_implementation.ps1`
- Comprehensive verification of all Sprint 2 objectives
- Automated checking of file locations, paths, and documentation
- All verification checks passed successfully

### Manual Verification
- Confirmed all moved files are accessible and functional
- Verified README.md accurately reflects new structure
- Tested that build and test commands work with new paths
- Validated documentation links and cross-references

## Impact and Benefits

### Developer Experience
- **Improved Navigation**: Clear, logical directory structure
- **Reduced Onboarding Time**: Intuitive file organization
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Related files centralized
- **Better Workflow**: Streamlined development processes

### Repository Quality
- **Clean Root Directory**: Only essential top-level files
- **Consistent Organization**: Predictable file locations

- **Professional Appearance**: Industry-standard layout

## Next Steps

Sprint 2 repository cleanup is complete. The codebase is now:
- Highly organized and navigable
- Fully functional with updated references
- Ready for continued development
- Compliant with best practices for repository organization

**Note**: Any compilation issues mentioned in previous discussions are separate from Sprint 2 scope (repository cleanup) and should be addressed in dedicated bug-fix sprints.
