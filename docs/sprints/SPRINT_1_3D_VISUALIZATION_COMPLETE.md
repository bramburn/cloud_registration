## Usage Instructions

### For Users
1. Load point cloud data through existing File → Open menu
2. Use mouse controls for navigation:
   - Left-click + drag: Orbit around data
   - Right-click + drag: Pan view
   - Scroll wheel: Zoom in/out
3. Use toolbar buttons for camera presets and settings
4. Enable LOD for large datasets via toolbar checkbox

### For Developers
```cpp
// Create and configure OpenGL renderer
OpenGLRenderer renderer;
renderer.initialize();
renderer.loadShaders("shaders/pointcloud.vert", "shaders/pointcloud.frag");

// Upload point cloud data
std::vector<float> points = loadPointCloudData();
renderer.uploadPointData(points);

// Setup camera controller
CameraController camera;
camera.fitToView(minBounds, maxBounds);

// Render frame
QMatrix4x4 mvp = camera.getProjectionMatrix(aspectRatio) * camera.getViewMatrix();
renderer.render(mvp, QVector3D(1,1,1), 2.0f);
```
