Backlog: Repository Cleanup - Sprint 1
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog for Sprint 1: Initial Relocation & Core Updates of the Repository Cleanup and Organization project. The primary goal of this sprint is to address the immediate clutter in the root directory by moving test scripts, sprint-specific documentation, and simple C++ test/demo files into dedicated, logical subdirectories. This foundational sprint will also ensure that all core build and test execution processes remain functional after the relocation.
2. User Stories

Each user story describes a specific aspect of the repository reorganization from a developer's perspective.
User Story 1: Relocate PowerShell Test Scripts

    Description: As a developer, I want all PowerShell scripts primarily used for testing or sprint-specific validation to be moved from the root directory into a new scripts/tests/ subdirectory. This will help centralize test automation and improve the clarity of the main project directory.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Create the scripts/tests/ directory if it does not already exist.

        Identify all .ps1 files currently in the root directory that are test-related. These include:

            run_sprint4_tests.ps1

            test_app.ps1

            test_debugging_implementation.ps1

            test_e57_comprehensive.ps1

            test_e57_fix_final.ps1

            test_e57_fix.ps1

            test_e57_implementation.ps1

            test_e57_parser_direct.ps1

            test_las_simple.ps1

            test_qt690_migration.ps1

            test_sprint1_1_implementation.ps1

            test_sprint1_2_implementation.ps1

            test_sprint1_2.ps1

            test_sprint1_3_implementation.ps1

            test_sprint1_4_integration.ps1

            test_sprint1_4_simple.ps1

            test_sprint1_functionality.ps1

            test_sprint2_3_implementation.ps1

            test_sprint2_comprehensive.ps1

            test_sprint2_functionality.ps1

            test_sprint2_simple_check.ps1

            test_sprint2_simple.ps1

            test_status_display_fix.ps1

            verify_e57_fix_complete.ps1

            verify_sprint1_implementation.ps1

            verify_sprint2_1_completion.ps1

            verify_sprint2_complete.ps1

            verify_sprint2_final.ps1

        Move the identified .ps1 files from the root directory to scripts/tests/.

        Update scripts/run-tests.ps1 and scripts/run-tests-fixed.ps1 to correctly call the test scripts from their new scripts/tests/ location.

        Review CMakeLists.txt for any add_test commands that directly invoke these .ps1 scripts and update their paths.

        Perform a basic scan of the moved .ps1 scripts for internal relative paths (e.g., to test_data/ or build/) and adjust them if necessary to function correctly from scripts/tests/ (e.g., using $PSScriptRoot or explicit relative paths from the project root).

    References between Files:

        scripts/run-tests.ps1 references scripts/tests/*.ps1.

        scripts/run-tests-fixed.ps1 references scripts/tests/*.ps1.

        CMakeLists.txt may reference scripts/tests/*.ps1 for test execution.

        Moved scripts/tests/*.ps1 files may reference test_data/, build/, or src/ directories.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        All .ps1 files listed above are successfully moved from the root to scripts/tests/.

        The scripts/tests/ directory is created and contains the relocated scripts.

        Executing .\scripts\run-tests.ps1 from the project root successfully runs all previously configured tests.

        Executing .\scripts\run-tests-fixed.ps1 from the project root successfully runs all previously configured tests.

        No broken references to these scripts are found in CMakeLists.txt.

User Story 2: Relocate Markdown Sprint Documentation

    Description: As a developer, I want sprint-specific documentation files (.md) to be moved from the root directory into a new docs/sprints/ subdirectory. This will centralize historical sprint information, making it easier to browse past development summaries and reports.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Create the docs/sprints/ directory if it does not already exist.

        Identify all .md files currently in the root directory that are sprint-specific. These include:

            BUILD_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md

            E57_PARSING_FIX_COMPLETE.md

            E57_PARSING_FIX_SUMMARY.md

            E57_PARSING_FIX_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md

            SPRINT_1_1_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md

            SPRINT_1_1_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

            SPRINT_1_2_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

            SPRINT_1_3_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

            SPRINT_1_4_FINAL_SUMMARY.md

            SPRINT_1_4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

            SPRINT_1_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md

            SPRINT3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md

            SPRINT4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

            test_sprint1_4.md

            verify_e57_fix.md

            verify_sprint1.md

        Move the identified .md files from the root directory to docs/sprints/.

        Review README.md, build-instructions.md, debugging_implementation_summary.md, and IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md (if they contain links to the moved files) and update any internal Markdown links to reflect the new docs/sprints/ paths.

        Scan the moved .md files themselves for any internal links that might point to other moved documents or code files, and update these links.

    References between Files:

        README.md may reference docs/sprints/*.md.

        build-instructions.md may reference docs/sprints/*.md.

        debugging_implementation_summary.md may reference docs/sprints/*.md.

        IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md may reference docs/sprints/*.md.

        Moved docs/sprints/*.md files may reference other docs/sprints/*.md files or code files in src/ or tests/.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        All .md files listed above are successfully moved from the root to docs/sprints/.

        The docs/sprints/ directory is created and contains the relocated documentation.

        All internal Markdown links within README.md, build-instructions.md, and other documentation files, as well as links between the moved sprint documents, remain functional.

User Story 3: Relocate C++ Demo/Simple Test Files

    Description: As a developer, I want simple C++ test files and small demonstration programs to be moved from the root directory into a new tests/demos/ subdirectory. This helps to clearly separate these utility programs from the main unit and integration test suites, and from core application source code.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Create the tests/demos/ directory if it does not already exist.

        Identify all .cpp files currently in the root directory that are simple tests or demos. These include:

            test_e57_parsing.cpp

            test_e57_simple.cpp

            test_las_parser.cpp

            test_las_real_file.cpp

            test_sprint1_implementation.cpp

            test_sprint2_2_profiling_demo.cpp

            test_sprint2_2_profiling.cpp

            test_sprint2_simple.cpp

            test_sprint3_demo.cpp

            test_voxel_manual.cpp

            test_voxel_simple.cpp

            test_sprint1_2_implementation.cpp

            test_sprint1_3_implementation.cpp

        Move the identified .cpp files from the root directory to tests/demos/.

        Update CMakeLists.txt to reflect the new paths for these moved .cpp files in any add_executable, target_sources, or add_test commands. Ensure include directories for these executables are correctly set (e.g., target_include_directories(my_demo PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/src)).

        Perform a basic scan of the moved .cpp files for internal relative paths (e.g., to test_data/ or src/) and adjust them if necessary.

    References between Files:

        CMakeLists.txt references tests/demos/*.cpp for compilation and executable creation.

        Moved tests/demos/*.cpp files may reference headers/source files in src/ or test_data/ files.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        All .cpp files listed above are successfully moved from the root to tests/demos/.

        The tests/demos/ directory is created and contains the relocated files.

        The project builds successfully without compilation or linking errors related to these moved files.

        Any executables generated from these moved files (e.g., test_e57_simple.exe, test_voxel_simple.exe) can be run successfully from their build output directory.

3. Actions to Undertake

This section summarizes all the specific tasks required for Sprint 1.

    Task 1.1: Create New Directories:

        Create scripts/tests/

        Create tests/demos/

        Create docs/sprints/

    Task 1.2: Relocate PowerShell Test Scripts: Move all .ps1 files from root to scripts/tests/ (excluding general utility scripts).

    Task 1.3: Relocate Markdown Sprint Documentation: Move all .md files from root to docs/sprints/ (excluding general project documentation).

    Task 1.4: Relocate C++ Demo/Simple Test Files: Move all .cpp files from root to tests/demos/.

    Task 1.5: Update CMakeLists.txt: Update all add_executable, target_sources, and add_test commands to reflect the new paths for moved .cpp files and .ps1 scripts.

    Task 1.6: Update Core PowerShell Scripts: Modify scripts/run-tests.ps1 and scripts/run-tests-fixed.ps1 to call test scripts from scripts/tests/.

    Task 1.7: Basic Codebase Scan for References: Perform a quick search for hardcoded paths to moved files within src/, tests/, and docs/ and update as necessary.

4. References between Files

This section outlines key relationships and dependencies affected by the file reorganization.

    Build System Integration: CMakeLists.txt is central, referencing all moved .ps1 and .cpp files for build and test execution. It will require path updates in add_executable, target_sources, add_test, and potentially target_include_directories.

    Script Execution Flow: scripts/run-tests.ps1 and scripts/run-tests-fixed.ps1 depend on the correct location of the .ps1 test scripts in scripts/tests/.

    Internal Script/Code Paths: Many moved .ps1 and .cpp files contain relative paths to test_data/, build/, src/, or other parts of the repository. These paths will need careful review and adjustment to remain functional from their new subdirectories.

    Documentation Links: Markdown files (.md) contain internal links to other documentation or source code files. These links must be updated to reflect the new docs/sprints/ structure for .md files and potentially updated paths for .cpp files.

5. List of Files being Created

This sprint primarily focuses on creating new directories to house the relocated files.

    File 1: scripts/tests/ (Directory)

        Purpose: To centralize all PowerShell scripts related to testing and sprint-specific validation, improving organization and reducing root directory clutter.

        Contents: Will contain all .ps1 files moved from the root directory that are identified as test-related.

        Relationships: Referenced by scripts/run-tests.ps1, scripts/run-tests-fixed.ps1, and CMakeLists.txt.

    File 2: tests/demos/ (Directory)

        Purpose: To house simple C++ test files and small demonstration programs, separating them from the main unit/integration test suite and core application source code.

        Contents: Will contain all .cpp files moved from the root directory that are identified as simple tests or demos.

        Relationships: Referenced by CMakeLists.txt for compilation and linking. May contain internal references to src/ or test_data/.

    File 3: docs/sprints/ (Directory)

        Purpose: To centralize all Markdown documentation files specific to development sprints (summaries, completion reports, verification reports), enhancing the navigability of historical project information.

        Contents: Will contain all .md files moved from the root directory that are identified as sprint-specific documentation.

        Relationships: May be referenced by README.md, build-instructions.md, debugging_implementation_summary.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, and other .md files.

6. Acceptance Criteria

The following criteria must be met to consider Sprint 1 complete:

    File Relocation:

        All .ps1 files (excluding build-clean.ps1, run-tests-fixed.ps1, run-tests.ps1, setup_libe57format.ps1, validate-phase1-clean.ps1, validate-phase1-simple.ps1, validate-phase1.ps1) are successfully moved from the root to scripts/tests/.

        All .md files (excluding README.md, build-instructions.md, debugging_implementation_summary.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) are successfully moved from the root to docs/sprints/.

        All .cpp files (e.g., test_e57_parsing.cpp, test_las_parser.cpp, test_sprint1_implementation.cpp, test_sprint2_2_profiling_demo.cpp, test_sprint3_demo.cpp, test_voxel_manual.cpp, test_sprint1_2_implementation.cpp, test_sprint1_3_implementation.cpp, test_e57_simple.cpp, test_las_real_file.cpp, test_sprint2_2_profiling.cpp, test_sprint2_simple.cpp, test_voxel_simple.cpp) are successfully moved from the root to tests/demos/.

    Directory Creation: The scripts/tests/, tests/demos/, and docs/sprints/ directories are created and populated correctly.

    Build System Integrity: The project builds successfully without any compilation or linking errors related to the moved files.

    Test Execution Integrity:

        Executing .\scripts\run-tests.ps1 from the project root runs all previously configured tests successfully.

        Executing .\scripts\run-tests-fixed.ps1 from the project root runs all previously configured tests successfully.

        Any executables generated from the moved tests/demos/*.cpp files can be run successfully.

    Documentation Link Integrity: All internal Markdown links within documentation files (including those in README.md and other docs/ files, as well as links between the moved sprint documents) remain functional.

    Root Directory Cleanliness: The root directory contains only essential project files (e.g., CMakeLists.txt, README.md, src/, scripts/, tests/, docs/, .gitignore).

7. Testing Plan

The testing plan for Sprint 1 focuses on verifying the successful relocation of files and the integrity of the build and test execution processes.

    Test Case 1.1: PowerShell Script Relocation Verification

        Test Data: The state of the repository before and after executing the relocation actions for PowerShell scripts.

        Expected Result: All specified .ps1 files are moved from the root to scripts/tests/. The scripts/tests/ directory exists and contains these files.

        Testing Tool: Manual file system inspection (e.g., ls -R or dir /s).

    Test Case 1.2: run-tests.ps1 Execution After Relocation

        Test Data: The project state after all PowerShell scripts have been relocated and CMakeLists.txt and scripts/run-tests.ps1 have been updated.

        Expected Result: Running .\scripts\run-tests.ps1 from the project root executes successfully, and all tests that were previously configured to run pass. No "file not found" errors or similar issues should occur.

        Testing Tool: PowerShell command line, ctest output verification.

    Test Case 1.3: run-tests-fixed.ps1 Execution After Relocation

        Test Data: The project state after all PowerShell scripts have been relocated and CMakeLists.txt and scripts/run-tests-fixed.ps1 have been updated.

        Expected Result: Running .\scripts\run-tests-fixed.ps1 from the project root executes successfully, and all tests pass.

        Testing Tool: PowerShell command line, ctest output verification.

    Test Case 2.1: Markdown Documentation Relocation Verification

        Test Data: The state of the repository before and after executing the relocation actions for Markdown documentation.

        Testing Tool: Manual file system inspection.

    Test Case 2.2: Markdown Link Validation

        Test Data: The project state after all Markdown documentation has been relocated and all internal links have been updated.

        Expected Result: Open README.md, build-instructions.md, debugging_implementation_summary.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, and several files from docs/sprints/. Click on all internal links within these documents to ensure they resolve correctly to their new locations.

        Testing Tool: Web browser or a Markdown viewer that supports internal link navigation.

    Test Case 3.1: C++ Demo/Simple Test Relocation Verification

        Test Data: The state of the repository before and after executing the relocation actions for C++ demo/simple test files.

        Expected Result: All specified .cpp files are moved from the root to tests/demos/. The tests/demos/ directory exists and contains these files.

        Testing Tool: Manual file system inspection.

    Test Case 3.2: Build Verification After C++ Relocation

        Test Data: The project state after all C++ demo/simple test files have been relocated and CMakeLists.txt has been updated.

        Expected Result: The project builds successfully using cmake --build . --config Debug (or Release) without any compilation or linking errors.

        Testing Tool: Command line execution of cmake --build.

    Test Case 3.3: Demo/Simple Test Execution

        Test Data: The built executables generated from the relocated tests/demos/*.cpp files.

        Expected Result: Run a representative sample of these executables (e.g., test_e57_simple.exe, test_voxel_simple.exe, test_sprint3_demo.exe) from their respective build output directories. They should execute without runtime errors or crashes.

        Testing Tool: Command line execution.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Repository State: The project is in a clean, buildable state before the start of Sprint 1.

    Build System: CMake (version 3.16+) is used as the primary build system and is correctly configured.

    PowerShell Environment: PowerShell is available and correctly configured on the development environment for executing .ps1 scripts.

    Markdown Viewer: A Markdown viewer or web browser capable of rendering Markdown and resolving local file links is available for documentation verification.

    C++ Toolchain: A C++17 compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC, GCC, Clang) and associated build tools are installed and configured.

    Existing Dependencies: All existing project dependencies (e.g., Qt6, Google Test, libE57Format via vcpkg) are correctly installed and integrated as per the current CMakeLists.txt and vcpkg.json. This backlog does not introduce new external dependencies.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Consistency: The new directory structure will be consistently applied to all relevant file types, ensuring a logical and predictable organization.

    Maintainability: The reorganized structure will make it easier for developers to find, understand, and maintain files, reducing the cognitive load of navigating the repository.

    Performance: The file relocation is not expected to introduce any measurable negative impact on build times, test execution speed, or application runtime performance.

    Backward Compatibility: The primary build and test execution commands (.\scripts\build-clean.ps1, .\scripts\run-tests.ps1) will remain functional from the project root, ensuring a smooth transition for developers.

    Clarity: The root directory will be significantly cleaner, containing only essential project-level files and top-level directories.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 1 lays the essential groundwork for a more organized and maintainable Cloud Registration repository. By systematically relocating test scripts, sprint documentation, and simple C++ programs, we aim to drastically reduce root directory clutter and establish a clear, consistent file structure. The detailed actions and comprehensive testing plan outlined in this backlog will ensure that this foundational reorganization is completed successfully without disrupting existing functionality.
