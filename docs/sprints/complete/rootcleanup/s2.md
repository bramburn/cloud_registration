Backlog: Repository Cleanup - Sprint 2
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog for Sprint 2: Internal Reference Refinement & Comprehensive Verification of the Repository Cleanup and Organization project. Building upon the foundational file relocations completed in Sprint 1, this sprint focuses on ensuring the integrity of all internal file references, validating documentation links, and performing a thorough, comprehensive verification of the entire project. The successful completion of this sprint will mark the finalization of the repository cleanup initiative, leaving the codebase in a highly organized and easily navigable state.
2. User Stories

Each user story describes a specific aspect of the repository reorganization from a developer's perspective, focusing on post-relocation integrity.
User Story 1: Refine Internal Code References

    Description: As a developer, I want all internal code references (e.g., file paths, includes) to correctly point to the new locations of the relocated files. This ensures that the codebase remains fully functional, preventing build failures, runtime errors, and unexpected behavior caused by outdated paths.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Systematic Search: Conduct a comprehensive search across src/, tests/, scripts/, and docs/ for any hardcoded or relative file paths that might still refer to the original root locations of the files moved in Sprint 1.

        Update QFile, QDir, QFileInfo Usage: Specifically review and update any instances of QFile::exists(), QFile::remove(), QDir::currentPath(), QFileInfo that might be affected by the new directory structure, ensuring they correctly resolve paths from the current context of the calling file.

        Adjust test_data/ Paths in C++ Tests: Pay particular attention to C++ test files (especially those moved to tests/demos/) that load or create files in test_data/. Ensure these paths are correctly specified relative to their new locations, or are dynamically resolved from the project root.

        Review C++ Include Paths: Verify that all #include directives in moved C++ files (e.g., tests/demos/*.cpp) correctly point to headers in src/ or other tests/ subdirectories.

        Review Script Internal Paths: Examine the content of all .ps1 scripts (now in scripts/ and scripts/tests/) for any internal file operations or references that assume a root-level execution context, and adjust them to correctly function from their new subdirectories.

    References between Files:

        src/**/*.cpp and src/**/*.h might contain references to test_data/ (less likely, but possible).

        tests/**/*.cpp and tests/**/*.h (including tests/demos/) frequently reference src/ headers, test_data/ files, and potentially other tests/ files.

        scripts/**/*.ps1 (including scripts/tests/) contain references to build/, test_data/, src/, and other scripts.

        CMakeLists.txt is the primary orchestrator, and its paths should have been updated in Sprint 1, but a final review is crucial.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The project builds successfully without any new compilation or linking errors related to unresolved file paths or missing includes.

        No runtime "file not found" errors or unexpected behavior occur when running the application or tests due to incorrect internal file references.

        A manual code review confirms that common path-related functions (QFile, QDir, QFileInfo) are used correctly with respect to the new directory structure.

User Story 2: Update Markdown Links

    Description: As a developer, I want all internal Markdown links within the documentation to correctly point to the new locations of relocated .md and .cpp files. This ensures that the project's documentation remains fully navigable and useful.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Review README.md: Open README.md and systematically click on every internal link to ensure it resolves to the correct new path (e.g., links to build-instructions.md, or potentially to relocated sprint summaries).

        Review General docs/ Files: Open other top-level documentation files in docs/ (e.g., build-instructions.md, debugging_implementation_summary.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md) and verify all internal links.

        Review docs/sprints/ Files: Open each .md file within docs/sprints/ and check all internal links. This includes links to other sprint documents, as well as links that might point to specific code files (.cpp, .h) or test scripts (.ps1).

        Update Link Syntax: Ensure that Markdown link syntax [text](path) is correctly used for relative paths, taking into account the new subdirectory structure.

    References between Files:

        README.md links to docs/*.md and potentially docs/sprints/*.md.

        docs/*.md files link to other docs/*.md files, docs/sprints/*.md, and potentially src/ or tests/ files.

        docs/sprints/*.md files link to other docs/sprints/*.md files, src/ files, tests/ files, and scripts/tests/ files.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        All internal Markdown links within README.md are functional.

        All internal Markdown links within other top-level docs/ files are functional.

        All internal Markdown links within files in docs/sprints/ are functional.

        No broken links are reported by automated link checkers (if used).

User Story 3: Update README.md for New Structure

    Description: As a new contributor, I want the README.md file to accurately reflect the new repository structure and any updated build/test commands. This provides a clear and up-to-date entry point for understanding and interacting with the project.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Review Structure Overview: Update any "Project Structure" or "Directory Layout" sections in README.md to accurately represent the new scripts/tests/, tests/demos/, and docs/sprints/ directories.

        Update Build Instructions: Verify that the build instructions in README.md are correct and functional with the new file paths (e.g., .\scripts\build-clean.ps1).

        Update Test Instructions: Ensure that the testing instructions in README.md correctly guide users to run tests using the updated scripts/run-tests.ps1 command.

        Remove Obsolete Information: Remove any references to old file locations or instructions that are no longer valid.

    References between Files:

        README.md describes the overall repository structure and references scripts/build-clean.ps1 and scripts/run-tests.ps1.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The "Project Structure" section in README.md accurately reflects the new directory layout.

        Build instructions in README.md successfully guide a user to build the project.

        Test instructions in README.md successfully guide a user to run tests.

        No outdated or incorrect information related to file paths remains in README.md.

User Story 4: Comprehensive Verification

    Description: As a quality assurance specialist, I want to ensure that the repository cleanup has not introduced any regressions and that the project remains fully functional and stable. This involves running all automated tests and performing manual smoke tests.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Full Automated Test Execution: Execute the comprehensive automated test suite using scripts/run-tests.ps1 -Coverage -Verbose.

        Review Test Results: Analyze the output of the automated tests to confirm a 100% pass rate. Investigate any failures or unexpected warnings.

        Code Coverage Review: If -Coverage is enabled, review the generated code coverage report to ensure it is still being generated correctly and that coverage metrics are not negatively impacted.

        Manual Smoke Testing - Application Launch: Launch the main CloudRegistration.exe application.

        Manual Smoke Testing - File Loading: Attempt to load a sample .e57 and a sample .las file to ensure the core loading and visualization functionality is intact.

        Manual Smoke Testing - Project Creation/Opening: Create a new project and open an existing one to verify project management functionality.

        Manual Smoke Testing - Basic UI Interaction: Perform basic UI interactions like camera controls, menu navigation, and settings dialog access.

    References between Files:

        scripts/run-tests.ps1 orchestrates the execution of tests located in tests/ and scripts/tests/.

        The CloudRegistration.exe executable (from build/) depends on the correctness of paths to src/ files and test_data/.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        All automated tests (unit, integration) pass with a 100% success rate.

        The CloudRegistration.exe application launches successfully.

        Sample .e57 and .las files load and display correctly.

        Project creation and opening functionality works as expected.

        Basic UI interactions (camera, menus) function without errors.

        No new warnings or errors appear during the build process or test execution that are related to file paths or missing resources.

User Story 5: Final Documentation Review

    Description: As a project maintainer, I want to ensure that all project documentation (including the docs/ directory) is coherent, up-to-date, and correctly organized, providing a reliable source of information for all contributors.

    Actions to Undertake:

        Directory Structure Review: Confirm that the docs/ directory now contains only general project documentation, and docs/sprints/ contains all sprint-specific documentation.

        Content Accuracy: Briefly review the content of key documentation files (README.md, build-instructions.md, debugging_implementation_summary.md, IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, and a sample of docs/sprints/*.md) to ensure their content is still accurate and relevant after the reorganization.

        Formatting Consistency: Check for consistent Markdown formatting across all documentation files.

        Completeness Check: Verify that no critical documentation (e.g., setup guides, API overviews) was accidentally moved or left outdated.

    References between Files:

        This task involves reviewing all files within the docs/ and docs/sprints/ directories.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        The docs/ and docs/sprints/ directories are logically organized as per the proposed structure.

        Key documentation files are up-to-date and reflect the current state of the repository.

        Documentation is free of major formatting errors.

        No critical documentation is missing or outdated.

        Verify completeness of documentation.

4. References between Files

This section outlines key relationships and dependencies affected by the file reorganization, with a focus on ensuring their integrity in Sprint 2.

    Build System Integration (CMakeLists.txt):

        Dependency: All C++ source files (src/**/*.cpp, tests/**/*.cpp, tests/demos/*.cpp) and test executables (tests/demos/*.exe) rely on CMakeLists.txt for correct compilation and linking.

        Data Flow: CMakeLists.txt defines how source files are compiled into executables and libraries, and how tests are registered with ctest.

    Script Execution Flow (scripts/*.ps1, scripts/tests/*.ps1):

        Dependency: scripts/run-tests.ps1 and scripts/run-tests-fixed.ps1 depend on the correct paths to all individual test scripts within scripts/tests/.

        Data Flow: These scripts orchestrate the execution of tests, often interacting with build/ directories for executables and test_data/ for test inputs.

    Internal Code References (src/**/*.cpp/h, tests/**/*.cpp/h):

        Dependency: C++ source and header files depend on correct #include paths for other internal modules (e.g., src/mainwindow.h including src/projecthubwidget.h).

        Data Flow: These files define data structures and APIs used across the application and test suites. Incorrect paths lead to compilation errors.

    Test Data Access (test_data/):

        Dependency: Many C++ test files and PowerShell test scripts rely on test_data/ for input files (e.g., .e57, .las).

        Data Flow: Test scripts/executables read from test_data/ and may write temporary output to build/ or test_data/.

    Documentation Links (docs/**/*.md):

        Dependency: All Markdown files depend on correct relative paths for internal links to other .md files (in docs/ or docs/sprints/) and potentially to code files in src/, tests/, or scripts/.

        Data Flow: These links facilitate navigation and cross-referencing within the project documentation.

5. List of Files being Created

Sprint 2 focuses on modifying existing files to update references, rather than creating new ones. No new files are anticipated to be created as part of this sprint's direct actions.
6. Acceptance Criteria

The following criteria must be met to consider Sprint 2 complete:

    Build Integrity: The project compiles and links successfully without any errors or warnings related to file paths, missing includes, or unresolved symbols.

    Automated Test Success: All automated tests (unit, integration, performance, etc.) executed via scripts/run-tests.ps1 (with -Coverage -Verbose) pass with a 100% success rate.

    Application Functionality:

        The CloudRegistration.exe application launches and runs without crashes.

        Core functionalities (e.g., loading sample .e57 and .las files, creating/opening projects, basic UI interaction) work as expected.

    Documentation Integrity:

        All internal Markdown links within README.md, docs/, and docs/sprints/ resolve correctly.

        The "Project Structure" and build/test instructions in README.md are accurate and up-to-date.

    Repository Cleanliness: The root directory remains clean, containing only essential project files and top-level directories, with no remnants of previously relocated files.

    No Regressions: No new bugs or regressions are introduced in existing functionality due to the cleanup.

7. Testing Plan

The testing plan for Sprint 2 is comprehensive, covering automated and manual verification to ensure full integrity after the reorganization.

    Test Case 1.1: Full Automated Test Suite Execution

        Test Data: The entire project codebase and all existing test data in test_data/.

        Expected Result: Run .\scripts\run-tests.ps1 -Coverage -Verbose. The script should complete successfully, and the final summary should report Total Tests: [X], Passed: [X], Failed: 0. The code coverage report should also generate correctly.

        Testing Tool: PowerShell command line, ctest output, lcov/genhtml output.

    Test Case 2.1: Application Launch and Basic Functionality

        Test Data: The compiled CloudRegistration.exe executable.

        Expected Result: Launch CloudRegistration.exe. The application window should appear without immediate crashes. Attempt to open a sample .e57 and .las file. Both should load and display correctly in the viewer. Create a new project and open an existing one.

        Testing Tool: Manual execution, visual inspection of the application UI.

    Test Case 3.1: Documentation Link Validation (Comprehensive)

        Test Data: All Markdown files in README.md, docs/, and docs/sprints/.

        Expected Result: Open each Markdown file in a web browser or a Markdown viewer. Systematically click on every internal link (both to other .md files and to code files) to confirm they resolve correctly. No "404 Not Found" or similar errors.

        Testing Tool: Web browser, Markdown viewer.

    Test Case 4.1: README.md Accuracy Check

        Test Data: The README.md file.

        Expected Result: Review the "Project Structure" section to ensure it matches the actual file system layout. Follow the "Building" and "Usage" instructions to confirm they are accurate and functional.

        Testing Tool: Manual review, command line execution of README.md instructions.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Sprint 1 Completion: All tasks and acceptance criteria from Sprint 1 are successfully met before the start of Sprint 2. This is a critical dependency, as Sprint 2 builds directly on the file relocations performed in Sprint 1.

    Automated Test Suite Coverage: The existing automated test suite provides sufficient coverage to detect regressions in core application functionality.

    Manual Testing Scope: Manual testing in this sprint is limited to smoke tests and visual verification; exhaustive functional testing is assumed to be covered by the automated suite.

    Tool Availability: All development tools (CMake, C++ compiler, PowerShell, Git) are correctly installed and configured.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Consistency: The repository structure will maintain a high degree of consistency, with clear and predictable locations for all file types.

    Maintainability: The codebase will be significantly easier to navigate and maintain, reducing onboarding time for new developers and simplifying future refactoring efforts.

    Performance: The cleanup will have no adverse impact on build times, test execution speed, or application runtime performance.

    Usability: The project's documentation will be highly usable, with accurate and functional links, providing a smooth experience for developers seeking information.

    Clarity: The overall project structure will be intuitive and self-documenting, reflecting best practices for repository organization.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 2 represents the culmination of the repository cleanup initiative. By meticulously refining internal references, validating all documentation links, and performing a comprehensive verification, we aim to deliver a highly organized, fully functional, and stable Cloud Registration project. The successful completion of this sprint will not only enhance developer experience but also establish a robust foundation for future development efforts.
