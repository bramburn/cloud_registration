 Sprint 1.3 Backlog: Point Cloud Viewer Enhancements

This backlog details the tasks for Sprint 1.3, focusing on improving the user experience of the point cloud viewer. The primary goals are to enable automatic "zoom to extent" functionality upon loading a point cloud and to eliminate application freezing during the loading process by implementing asynchronous parsing.
1. Introduction

Sprint 1.3 addresses critical usability and performance issues within the point cloud viewer. By allowing the viewer to automatically frame the loaded point cloud, we enhance immediate visual understanding. Furthermore, by moving the computationally intensive parsing operations to a separate thread, we ensure the application remains responsive, providing a smoother user experience and real-time loading progress feedback.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: User can automatically zoom to the extent of the loaded point cloud

        Description: As a user, when a point cloud file is successfully loaded, I want the viewer to automatically adjust the camera position and zoom level to perfectly frame the entire point cloud within the view, so that I can immediately see the complete dataset without manual adjustment.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Frontend (Qt/OpenGL):

                Review and refine the PointCloudViewerWidget::calculateBoundingBox() method to ensure accurate calculation of m_boundingBoxMin, m_boundingBoxMax, m_boundingBoxCenter, and m_boundingBoxSize.

                In PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud, after calculateBoundingBox(), implement logic to set m_cameraTarget to m_boundingBoxCenter.

                Calculate an appropriate m_cameraDistance based on m_boundingBoxSize and the viewer's aspect ratio/field of view, ensuring the entire bounding box is visible. A common approach is m_cameraDistance = m_boundingBoxSize / (2 * tan(FOV/2)) * aspect_correction_factor.

                Call PointCloudViewerWidget::updateCamera() after setting the new target and distance.

                (Optional for MVP, but good for future) Add a dedicated "Fit to View" button in MainWindow that triggers this camera adjustment on demand.

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: loadPointCloud(), calculateBoundingBox(), updateCamera().

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h: Member variables for bounding box and camera.

            src/mainwindow.cpp: Calls m_viewer->loadPointCloud().

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Upon successful loading of any .e57 or .las file, the point cloud is fully visible within the PointCloudViewerWidget.

            The point cloud appears centered within the viewer's frame.

            No part of the point cloud is clipped by the viewer's boundaries.

            The zoom level is appropriate, not excessively zoomed in or out.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.3.1.1: Load a small, centered point cloud.

                Test Data: test_las_parser.cpp generated LAS file (3 points).

                Expected Result: The 3 points are clearly visible and centered in the viewer.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

            Test Case 1.3.1.2: Load a large, off-center point cloud (if available, or simulate with mock data).

                Test Data: Mock E57 data (sphere with noise).

                Expected Result: The entire sphere is visible and centered, regardless of its generated coordinates.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

            Test Case 1.3.1.3: Load a point cloud with extreme aspect ratios (e.g., very long and thin).

                Test Data: Custom generated data (e.g., points along a line).

                Expected Result: The entire line is visible, appropriately scaled.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

    User Story 2: Application remains responsive during point cloud loading

        Description: As a user, when a point cloud file is being loaded, I want the application's user interface to remain responsive (e.g., I can drag the window, see progress updates) so that the application does not appear frozen and I am aware of the loading status.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Backend (Qt/C++):

                Thread Creation: Create a QThread instance in MainWindow to run the parsing operations.

                Parser Object Management: Move m_e57Parser and m_lasParser (or new instances of them) to the newly created QThread using moveToThread(). Ensure these parser objects are instantiated after the thread is created but before they are moved.

                Signal/Slot Connections:

                    Connect QThread::started() to a slot in MainWindow to initiate parsing.

                    Connect QThread::finished() to a slot in MainWindow for cleanup and finalization.

                    Connect LasParser::progressUpdated and E57Parser::progressUpdated signals (from the parser object in the worker thread) to a slot in MainWindow to update the QProgressDialog. Use Qt::QueuedConnection for thread-safe updates.

                    Connect LasParser::parsingFinished and E57Parser::parsingFinished signals to MainWindow::onLoadingFinished (or a new slot that then calls it), passing the std::vector<float> of points. Use Qt::QueuedConnection for safe data transfer.

                Data Transfer: Ensure the std::vector<float> is passed by value or a shared pointer in the parsingFinished signal to avoid data races. Qt's Q_DECLARE_METATYPE and qRegisterMetaType might be needed for std::vector<float> if it's not implicitly convertible.

                Error Handling: Ensure exceptions from parsers are caught within the worker thread and communicated back via signals.

            Frontend (Qt/UI):

                Modify MainWindow::onOpenFileClicked() to:

                    Instantiate and start the QThread.

                    Move the chosen parser object to the thread.

                    Connect the necessary signals/slots.

                    Start the parsing operation via a slot connected to QThread::started().

                Update MainWindow::onLoadingFinished() to handle the std::vector<float> passed from the parser.

                Modify QProgressDialog to use the progressUpdated signal to show determinate progress (set m_progressDialog->setMaximum(100) and m_progressDialog->setValue(percentage)).

        References between Files:

            src/mainwindow.cpp, src/mainwindow.h: Will manage QThread, connect signals/slots, update UI.

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: loadPointCloud() will receive data from MainWindow (now from worker thread).

            src/lasparser.cpp, src/lasparser.h, src/e57parser.cpp, src/e57parser.h: Parsers will emit signals.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When a point cloud file is loading, the MainWindow remains fully responsive (e.g., can be moved, resized, other buttons/menus can be interacted with).

            The QProgressDialog displays a progress bar that updates from 0% to 100% during the loading process.

            The application does not visibly freeze or become unresponsive at any point during file parsing and data transfer.

            Upon completion (success or failure), the QProgressDialog closes, and the status bar updates appropriately.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.3.2.1: Load a large point cloud file (e.g., 100,000+ points).

                Test Data: Large .las or .e57 file (or mock data generation with a delay).

                Expected Result: The progress dialog appears and updates. The main window remains interactive (e.g., try to drag the window, click "About" menu item).

                Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction, task manager (to observe CPU/memory usage if freezing occurs).

            Test Case 1.3.2.2: Cancel loading via progress dialog (if cancel button is active).

                Test Data: Start loading a large file, click "Cancel" on the progress dialog.

                Expected Result: Loading process is aborted, resources are cleaned up, and the UI returns to a ready state.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction.

            Test Case 1.3.2.3: Load a small point cloud file.

                Test Data: Small .las or .e57 file (e.g., 1000 points).

                Expected Result: Loading is very fast, progress dialog might flash briefly or show quick progress. No freezing.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

            Test Case 1.3.2.4: Error during loading (e.g., corrupted file).

                Test Data: Provide a corrupted or unreadable file.

                Expected Result: Progress dialog closes, error message is displayed in QMessageBox, and the UI remains responsive.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction.

3. Actions to Undertake (Consolidated)

    Core Logic Refinement (src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp/.h):

        Refine PointCloudViewerWidget::calculateBoundingBox() to ensure robust min/max calculation.

        Adjust camera calculation in PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud() and updateCamera() to ensure optimal "fit to view" based on bounding box and aspect ratio.

    Asynchronous Parsing Implementation (src/mainwindow.cpp/.h, src/lasparser.h/.cpp, src/e57parser.h/.cpp):

        MainWindow Modifications:

            Add QThread *m_parserThread; member to MainWindow.h.

            In MainWindow::onOpenFileClicked():

                Create m_parserThread = new QThread(this);.

                Create new instances of E57Parser or LasParser (e.g., E57Parser *workerParser = new E57Parser();).

                Move the workerParser to the thread: workerParser->moveToThread(m_parserThread);.

                Connect m_parserThread->started() to a new slot in workerParser (e.g., workerParser->startParsing(m_currentFilePath);).

                Connect workerParser->progressUpdated to MainWindow::onParsingProgressUpdated(int).

                Connect workerParser->parsingFinished to MainWindow::onParsingFinished(bool, const QString&, const std::vector<float>&).

                Connect m_parserThread->finished() to workerParser->deleteLater() and m_parserThread->deleteLater().

                Start the thread: m_parserThread->start();.

            Add new slots to MainWindow.h:

                void onParsingProgressUpdated(int percentage);

                void onParsingFinished(bool success, const QString& message, const std::vector<float>& points);

            Implement these new slots in MainWindow.cpp:

                onParsingProgressUpdated: Update m_progressDialog->setValue(percentage).

                onParsingFinished: This will replace the current logic inside the QTimer::singleShot lambda. It will call m_viewer->loadPointCloud(points) if successful, then handle m_isLoading, m_openFileButton, m_progressDialog cleanup, and status bar updates.

            Modify QProgressDialog creation in MainWindow::onOpenFileClicked(): m_progressDialog->setMaximum(100); to make it determinate.

        Parser Modifications (src/lasparser.h/.cpp, src/e57parser.h/.cpp):

            Add a public slot void startParsing(const QString& filePath); to both LasParser and E57Parser. This slot will encapsulate the existing parse() logic.

            Ensure parse() method (now called from startParsing) correctly emits progressUpdated and parsingFinished signals.

            For parsingFinished signal, ensure std::vector<float> is passed by value or QSharedPointer<std::vector<float>> to guarantee thread-safe data transfer. If passing by value, ensure std::vector<float> is registered as a metatype: qRegisterMetaType<std::vector<float>>("std::vector<float>");.

    Error Handling:

        Ensure all parsing errors are caught within the worker thread and propagated via the parsingFinished signal.

4. References between Files (Consolidated)

    src/mainwindow.cpp and src/mainwindow.h will be the central orchestrators, managing QThread instances and connecting signals/slots from parsers.

    src/lasparser.cpp, src/lasparser.h, src/e57parser.cpp, src/e57parser.h will act as worker objects, performing the heavy lifting of file parsing and emitting progress/completion signals.

    src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp and src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h will receive the parsed point data from MainWindow and handle the rendering and camera adjustments.

    Qt's QThread, QObject::moveToThread, Q_DECLARE_METATYPE, qRegisterMetaType will be fundamental for thread-safe operations and data transfer.

    The QProgressDialog displays a progress bar that updates from 0% to 100% during the loading process.

    The application does not visibly freeze or become unresponsive at any point during file parsing and data transfer.

    Upon completion (success or failure), the QProgressDialog closes, and the status bar updates appropriately.

7. Testing Plan

    Test Case 1.3.1.1: Load a small, centered point cloud.

        Test Data: test_las_parser.cpp generated LAS file (3 points).

        Expected Result: The 3 points are clearly visible and centered in the viewer.

        Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

    Test Case 1.3.1.2: Load a large, off-center point cloud (if available, or simulate with mock data).

        Test Data: Mock E57 data (sphere with noise).

        Expected Result: The entire sphere is visible and centered, regardless of its generated coordinates.

        Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

    Test Case 1.3.1.3: Load a point cloud with extreme aspect ratios (e.g., very long and thin).

        Test Data: Custom generated data (e.g., points along a line).

        Expected Result: The entire line is visible, appropriately scaled.

        Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

    Test Case 1.3.2.1: Load a large point cloud file (e.g., 100,000+ points).

        Test Data: Large .las or .e57 file (or mock data generation with a delay).

        Expected Result: The progress dialog appears and updates. The main window remains interactive (e.g., try to drag the window, click "About" menu item).

        Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction, task manager (to observe CPU/memory usage if freezing occurs).

    Test Case 1.3.2.2: Cancel loading via progress dialog (if cancel button is active).

        Test Data: Start loading a large file, click "Cancel" on the progress dialog.

        Expected Result: Loading process is aborted, resources are cleaned up, and the UI returns to a ready state.

        Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction.

    Test Case 1.3.2.3: Load a small point cloud file.

        Test Data: Small .las or .e57 file (e.g., 1000 points).

        Expected Result: Loading is very fast, progress dialog might flash briefly or show quick progress. No freezing.

        Testing Tool: Manual UI observation.

    Test Case 1.3.2.4: Error during loading (e.g., corrupted file).

        Test Data: Provide a corrupted or unreadable file.

        Expected Result: Progress dialog closes, error message is displayed in QMessageBox, and the UI remains responsive.

        Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Qt Environment: A functional Qt development environment is set up.

    C++ Compiler: A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC) is available.

    Existing Codebase: The code from previous sprints (parsers, viewer widget, main window) is available and functional.

    Parser Signals: The LasParser and E57Parser classes correctly emit progressUpdated(int) and parsingFinished(bool, const QString&) signals as per their current implementation.

    std::vector<float> as Metatype: If std::vector<float> is passed directly in signals across threads, it must be registered as a Qt metatype.

    Thread Safety: While QThread and queued connections handle most UI thread safety, ensure no direct shared data access between worker and UI threads without proper synchronization (e.g., mutexes), though for this scope, passing data via signals is generally safe.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        The application's UI should maintain a high frame rate (e.g., >30 FPS) during point cloud loading.

        Memory usage during loading should be optimized to prevent excessive consumption, especially for large datasets.

    Usability:

        The "zoom to extent" feature should be intuitive and require no user intervention.

        The loading progress dialog should be clear and accurately reflect the parsing progress.

    Reliability:

        The threading model should be robust, preventing crashes due to race conditions or improper thread termination.

        Error handling during parsing should be comprehensive, providing informative feedback to the user.

    Maintainability:

        The threading logic should be encapsulated and easy to understand.

        The camera adjustment logic should be clean and configurable.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 1.3 is crucial for enhancing the user experience of the point cloud viewer. By implementing automatic "zoom to extent" and, more importantly, offloading the parsing process to a separate thread, we will significantly improve the application's responsiveness and perceived performance. This will result in a much more professional and user-friendly tool for working with point cloud data.
