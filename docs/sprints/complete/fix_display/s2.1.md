Sprint 2.1 Backlog: E57 Basic Codec Handling

Sprint Goal: To enhance the E57Parser to identify and handle at least one common, simple E57 codec for compressed point data within CompressedVector sections, enabling the application to load a broader range of E57 files.
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint 2.1 of Phase 2 for the "Robust Point Cloud Loading (.e57 & .las)" project. Building on the successful completion of Phase 1, this sprint focuses on extending the E57Parser's capabilities to handle compressed point data. This involves researching common E57 codecs, selecting one or two simple ones for implementation, and integrating the decompression logic into the existing parsing workflow. This directly addresses PRD requirement FR4.
2. User Stories
User Story 1 (Sprint 2.1): Research and Select E57 Codec(s) for Implementation

    As a developer,

    I want to research common E57 codecs used within CompressedVector for point data (especially for Cartesian coordinates) and select one or two simple, prevalent codecs for implementation,

    So that the E57Parser can be enhanced to support a wider range of E57 files without introducing significant external library dependencies.

        Description: The ASTM E57 standard allows for various codecs to compress data within a CompressedVector. This initial story involves investigating which codecs are most frequently encountered in typical E57 files for XYZ float data and identifying those that are relatively straightforward to implement (e.g., simple bit-packing, or a basic scheme that doesn't require a full-blown compression library). The output of this research will determine the specific codec(s) to be implemented in User Story 2.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.1.1.1: Review the ASTM E57 standard documentation regarding CompressedVector codecs and their specifications.

            Task 2.1.1.2: Analyze publicly available E57 sample files or use tools to inspect their structure and identify commonly used codecs for point data.

            Task 2.1.1.3: Evaluate the implementation complexity of the identified common codecs. Prioritize those that can be implemented with reasonable effort using standard C++/Qt capabilities.

            Task 2.1.1.4: Document the findings, including the selected codec(s) (e.g., "E57 Bit-Packed Float Codec" - hypothetical name for a simple scheme if one exists, or a specific named codec if simple enough), their specifications, and the rationale for selection.

            Task 2.1.1.5: Identify how the E57 XML section (specifically within the codecs and CompressedVectorNode elements) declares the use of the selected codec(s) and any parameters they might have.

        References between Files:

            ASTM E57 Standard Document (external).

            src/e57parser.h, src/e57parser.cpp: The findings will inform future modifications here.

            Potentially a new internal design note or research summary document.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A clear decision is made on one or two specific, simple E57 codecs to target for implementation in this sprint.

            The E57 XML representation for declaring these codecs and their parameters is understood and documented.

            The technical specification for decompressing data using the selected codec(s) is understood.

            A brief report summarizing the research, findings, and selected codec(s) is produced.

        Testing Plan:

            Not directly testable via code execution in this user story.

            Verification: Review of the research documentation and codec selection rationale by the team. Confirmation that the selected codec's specification is clear enough for implementation.

User Story 2 (Sprint 2.1): Implement Decompression for Selected E57 Codec

    As a developer,

    I want to implement the decompression logic for the selected simple E57 codec(s) (e.g., "Bit-Packed Float Codec") within the E57Parser,

    So that the application can correctly extract XYZ point data from E57 files that use this specific compression.

        Description: Based on the codec(s) selected in User Story 1, this story involves writing the C++ code to decompress the binary point data. This logic will be integrated into E57Parser::extractPointsFromBinarySection or a new helper function. The parser must first identify from the XML that this codec is in use.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.1.2.1: Modify E57Parser::parseXmlSection (or parseData3D/parseCompressedVectorNode) to:

                Detect the presence and type of the selected codec(s) from the E57 XML (e.g., by checking specific string identifiers or structures within the codecs / CompressedVectorNode elements).

                Extract any necessary parameters for the codec from the XML (e.g., bit precision, block sizes, if applicable).

                Store this codec information (type, parameters) for use during binary data extraction.

            Task 2.1.2.2: Create a new private method in E57Parser (e.g., decompressBitPackedFloats(QDataStream& stream, qint64 recordCount, CodecParams params, std::vector<float>& outPoints)) or similar for each selected codec.

            Task 2.1.2.3: Implement the decompression algorithm within this new method(s) according to the codec's specification. This will involve reading the compressed byte stream and converting it back into single-precision XYZ float values.

            Task 2.1.2.4: Modify E57Parser::extractPointsFromBinarySection to:

                Check if a selected codec was identified for the current binary section.

                If so, call the appropriate decompression method instead of attempting a direct float read.

                If no recognized/supported codec is found, but the XML indicates compression, it should fail gracefully with an "Unsupported codec" error.

            Task 2.1.2.5: Ensure robust error handling within the decompression logic (e.g., for corrupted compressed data, unexpected stream end).

            Task 2.1.2.6: Write unit tests for the decompression logic using known compressed data patterns and their expected uncompressed output.

        References between Files:

            src/e57parser.h: Declaration of E57Parser; may need new member variables for codec parameters or new private method declarations for decompression.

            src/e57parser.cpp: Implementation of XML parsing for codec identification, new decompression method(s), and modifications to extractPointsFromBinarySection.

            tests/test_e57parser.cpp: New unit tests for the decompression logic and integration tests for loading E57 files using the implemented codec.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The E57Parser can correctly identify from the E57 XML when the implemented codec(s) is used for a point data section.

            Given an E57 file using the implemented codec(s) for XYZ float data:

                The parser successfully calls the new decompression logic.

                The decompression logic correctly reconstructs the original XYZ float values.

                The application loads and displays the point cloud accurately.

            If an E57 file uses a compression codec that is not the one(s) implemented, the parser fails with an "Unsupported E57 compression codec" error message.

            Decompression errors (e.g., corrupted data) are handled gracefully and reported.

        Testing Plan:

            Unit Tests:

                Test Case 2.1.2.A: Test XML parsing for codec identification.

                    Test Data: XML snippet declaring the implemented codec with its parameters.

                    Expected Result: Parser correctly identifies the codec and extracts its parameters.

                    Testing Tool: gtest.

                Test Case 2.1.2.B: Test the decompression function directly with a known small block of compressed data.

                    Test Data: Byte array of data compressed with the implemented codec, corresponding expected float values.

                    Expected Result: Decompression function outputs the correct float values.

                    Testing Tool: gtest.

                Test Case 2.1.2.C: Test decompression with intentionally corrupted compressed data.

                    Test Data: Byte array of malformed compressed data.

                    Expected Result: Decompression function reports an error or fails gracefully.

                    Testing Tool: gtest.

            Integration Tests:

                Test Case 2.1.2.D: Load a complete E57 file that uses the implemented codec for its point data.

                    Test Data: e57_codec_xyz_data.e57 (new test file).

                    Expected Result: Application loads and displays the point cloud correctly. Points match known ground truth for the test file.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing, visual verification, debug logs.

                Test Case 2.1.2.E: Attempt to load an E57 file that uses a different, unsupported compression codec.

                    Test Data: e57_unsupported_codec.e57 (new test file).

                    Expected Result: Application displays an "Unsupported E57 compression codec" error message. No points are loaded.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)
4. References between Files

    src/e57parser.h & src/e57parser.cpp: Core files for E57 parsing logic, XML interpretation for codecs, and implementation of decompression algorithms.

    src/mainwindow.cpp: Handles signals from E57Parser, updates UI with success/failure including new error types like "Unsupported codec".

    tests/test_e57parser.cpp: For unit testing new decompression logic and codec identification.

    E57Parser reads file -> Parses Header -> Parses XML (identifies codec type and parameters from CompressedVectorNode)

    If supported codec identified -> E57Parser::extractPointsFromBinarySection calls specific decompression method.

    Decompression method reads binary data -> reconstructs float XYZ points.

    E57Parser emits parsingFinished(success, message, points).

    MainWindow::onParsingFinished receives signal -> Displays points or error message.

6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)

Sprint 2.1 Definition of Done (from PRD):

    Research on common E57 codecs for CompressedVector is completed.

    At least one common, simple codec is selected for implementation based on findings.

    E57Parser is updated to identify the selected codec(s) from the E57 XML.

    Decompression logic for the selected codec(s) is implemented in E57Parser.

    The application can successfully load and display point data from E57 files that use the implemented basic compression codec(s).

    If an unsupported codec is encountered, a clear error message is provided.

7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
Unit tests (gtest) for the specific decompression algorithm and XML codec identification are crucial. Integration testing with specially crafted E57 files using the implemented codec will validate the end-to-end functionality.
8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        That one or two common E57 codecs for XYZ float data are simple enough to be implemented without requiring large external compression libraries (e.g., zlib, etc.), aligning with the PRD's preference to enhance existing C++ code.

        The E57 XML clearly and unambiguously declares the codec type and any necessary parameters for the implemented codec(s).

        Test E57 files using the target codec(s) can be created or obtained. This might involve writing a small utility to compress data into the target format if publicly available samples are scarce.

    Dependencies:

        Successful completion of all Phase 1 backlog items, ensuring the basic E57 parsing infrastructure (header, XML navigation, uncompressed data extraction) is stable.

        Access to clear specifications for the selected E57 codec(s) (from ASTM E57 standard or other reliable sources).

        Qt 6 framework.

        Google Test framework.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

(Referencing the main PRD. For this sprint, the most relevant are):

    NFR1 (Performance): Decompression of the selected basic codec(s) should be reasonably efficient and not introduce major performance regressions for loading.

    NFR3 (Maintainability): The new codec handling and decompression logic in E57Parser must be well-structured, commented, and understandable.

    NFR4 (Robustness): The parser must robustly handle files with the supported codec, and gracefully fail (with clear errors) for unsupported codecs or corrupted compressed data.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 2.1 marks an important step in increasing the versatility of the E57Parser by adding support for compressed data. By focusing on common and simpler codecs first, the application can start handling a wider variety of real-world E57 files, improving its utility for users. The research component is key to ensuring development effort is directed effectively.
