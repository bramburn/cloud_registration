Sprint 1.2 Backlog: E57 CompressedVector & Enhanced Error Handling

Sprint Goal: To enable the E57Parser to correctly interpret CompressedVector metadata for locating uncompressed point data and to significantly improve the specificity and usefulness of error messages reported to the user during E57 parsing failures.
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint 1.2 of the "Robust Point Cloud Loading (.e57 & .las)" project. This sprint builds upon the foundational E57 parsing capabilities developed in Sprint 1.1. The primary focus is on handling E57 files where point data, although uncompressed, is described within a CompressedVector structure (requiring deeper XML navigation into codecs and CompressedVectorNode) and on enhancing the error reporting mechanism of the E57Parser. This sprint directly addresses PRD requirements related to robust E57 parsing and user-facing error feedback.
2. User Stories
User Story 1 (Sprint 1.2): Robust CompressedVector Metadata Extraction for Uncompressed Points

    As a developer,

    I want to enhance the E57Parser's XML processing to accurately interpret points elements of type CompressedVector and their associated codecs (specifically CompressedVectorNode children),

    So that I can reliably locate the true fileOffset (or equivalent binary section reference) and recordCount for uncompressed point data, even when this information is nested within the codecs structure.

        Description: Sprint 1.1 handled simpler cases where fileOffset might be more directly available. This story addresses E57 files where the points element is a CompressedVector. In such cases, the actual location of the binary point data is often described within a child codecs element, which in turn contains one or more CompressedVectorNode elements. Each CompressedVectorNode can specify a binarySection (which might be a string reference or imply an offset) and its own recordCount. For this sprint, we are still assuming the underlying point data within these binary sections is uncompressed XYZ floats. The parser needs to correctly navigate this structure to find the correct parameters for data extraction.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 1.2.1.1: Modify E57Parser::parseData3D (or a new helper function called from it) to specifically handle points elements that have type="CompressedVector".

            Task 1.2.1.2: Within this logic, locate and parse the child codecs element (typically a Vector of CompressedVectorNode).

            Task 1.2.1.3: Iterate through CompressedVectorNode elements within codecs. For this sprint, assume the first relevant CompressedVectorNode that describes the XYZ data is used.

            Task 1.2.1.4: From the CompressedVectorNode, extract:

                recordCount: The number of records (points) described by this node.

                binarySection (or similar attribute/element, e.g., fileOffset if present directly, or a reference that can be resolved to an offset): This indicates where the binary data for these points is stored. For this sprint, if it's a string reference, we might initially assume it corresponds to a binary section immediately following the XML or at a known location based on simpler E57 profiles. Further investigation into how binarySection string references are resolved to offsets in the ASTM E57 standard is needed.

                The prototype within the CompressedVectorNode (or inherited from the parent points element) to confirm it still describes uncompressed XYZ floats.

            Task 1.2.1.5: Update E57Parser member variables (e.g., m_binaryDataOffset, m_recordCount) with the values obtained from the CompressedVectorNode.

            Task 1.2.1.6: Ensure that E57Parser::extractPointsFromBinarySection is subsequently called with these accurately determined parameters.

            Task 1.2.1.7: Implement error handling for missing codecs, CompressedVectorNode, or required attributes within these elements.

        References between Files:

            src/e57parser.h: Declaration of E57Parser class. Member variables might need adjustment if new intermediate data from CompressedVectorNode needs to be stored.

            src/e57parser.cpp: Significant modifications in parseXmlSection (or parseData3D) to handle CompressedVector and CompressedVectorNode logic. extractPointsFromBinarySection will use the refined offset/count.

            tests/test_e57parser.cpp: New unit tests for parsing XML snippets containing CompressedVector and CompressedVectorNode. New integration tests using E57 files with this structure.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Given a valid E57 file where uncompressed XYZ point data is described within a points type="CompressedVector" element, with location details in a child CompressedVectorNode:

                The E57Parser successfully parses the XML, including the codecs and CompressedVectorNode elements.

                The parser correctly identifies the fileOffset (or resolves binarySection to an offset) and recordCount for the point data from the CompressedVectorNode.

                The parser correctly extracts and displays the uncompressed XYZ point data.

                If the CompressedVector structure is malformed or essential information is missing, parsing fails with a specific error.

        Testing Plan:

            Unit Tests:

                Test Case 1.2.1.1: Parse an XML snippet with a points type="CompressedVector" element containing a codecs section with one CompressedVectorNode that defines recordCount and a resolvable binarySection (e.g., assuming fileOffset is an attribute for now, or a simple scheme for binarySection string).

                    Test Data: XML string.

                    Expected Result: recordCount and binary data offset are correctly extracted.

                    Testing Tool: gtest.

                Test Case 1.2.1.2: Parse an XML snippet with a CompressedVectorNode missing recordCount.

                    Test Data: XML string.

                    Expected Result: Parser reports an error, parsing fails.

                    Testing Tool: gtest.

            Integration Test:

                Test Case 1.2.1.3: Load a complete E57 file structured with points type="CompressedVector" and CompressedVectorNode describing uncompressed XYZ data.

                    Test Data: compressedvector_uncompressed_data.e57 (new test file).

                    Expected Result: The application loads and displays the points correctly. The internal state of E57Parser shows correct recordCount and binaryDataOffset derived from the CompressedVectorNode.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing, visual verification, debug logs.

User Story 2 (Sprint 1.2): Specific and Informative E57 Parsing Error Messages

    As a user,

    I want to receive specific and understandable error messages when the application fails to parse an E57 file,

    So that I can better diagnose the issue with my file or understand the application's limitations.

        Description: Currently, error reporting in E57Parser might be generic. This user story focuses on making these messages more granular and helpful. For example, instead of a general "XML parsing failed," a message like "XML parsing failed: Missing 'points' element in 'data3D'" is much more useful.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 1.2.2.1: Review all current error-setting points (setError()) in E57Parser.cpp.

            Task 1.2.2.2: Enhance setError() or create new error reporting mechanisms to include more context, such as:

                The specific E57 element being processed when the error occurred.

                The nature of the error (e.g., "Attribute 'recordCount' not found in 'points' element", "Invalid value for 'versionMajor' in header", "File section referenced by 'binarySection' not found").

                Line and column numbers for XML parsing errors (if available from QDomDocument).

            Task 1.2.2.3: Update existing error conditions in parseHeader, parseXmlSection, parseData3D, and extractPointsFromBinarySection to use the enhanced error reporting.

            Task 1.2.2.4: Add new error checks and messages for scenarios identified during the implementation of User Story 1 (Sprint 1.2), e.g., errors related to CompressedVectorNode parsing.

            Task 1.2.2.5: Ensure these detailed error messages are propagated correctly through the parsingFinished signal to MainWindow and displayed to the user (e.g., in the QMessageBox and status bar).

        References between Files:

            src/e57parser.h: Potentially minor changes to E57ParseException if more structured error info is needed.

            src/e57parser.cpp: Modifications throughout the file to implement detailed error setting.

            src/mainwindow.cpp: Ensure updateUIAfterParsing and QMessageBox display the full, detailed error messages from E57Parser.

            tests/test_e57parser.cpp: Unit tests to verify that specific error conditions trigger the correct, detailed error messages.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When E57 parsing fails due to a known, specific reason (e.g., missing attribute, unexpected element):

                The error message provided by E57Parser::getLastError() is detailed and indicates the specific cause and location (if applicable) of the error.

                The MainWindow displays this detailed error message to the user.

            For example, if an E57 file's XML is missing the recordCount attribute in a points element, the error message should reflect this specifically, not just "XML parse error."

        Testing Plan:

            Unit Tests:

                For each distinct error condition implemented:

                    Test Case 1.2.2.X: Trigger a specific parsing error (e.g., provide an XML snippet missing a required attribute).

                        Test Data: Modified E57 file content or XML string designed to cause a specific failure.

                        Expected Result: E57Parser::getLastError() returns the expected detailed error message. parse() indicates failure.

                        Testing Tool: gtest.

            Integration Tests:

                Test Case 1.2.2.Y: Load various malformed E57 files in the application.

                    Test Data: corrupt_header.e57, malformed_xml.e57, missing_points_definition.e57, and a new malformed_compressedvector.e57.

                    Expected Result: The application displays a user-friendly dialog box containing the specific, detailed error message generated by the parser.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)
4. References between Files

    src/e57parser.h: Interface definition for E57Parser.

    src/e57parser.cpp: Implementation of E57Parser, especially XML navigation for CompressedVectorNode and enhanced setError logic.

    src/mainwindow.cpp: onParsingFinished to display detailed errors.

    tests/test_e57parser.cpp: Will require new tests for CompressedVector parsing and for verifying specific error messages.

Data Flows: (Similar to Sprint 1.1, but with more complex XML parsing logic within E57Parser)

    MainWindow -> E57Parser::startParsing(filePath)

    E57Parser reads file -> Parses Header -> Parses XML (including CompressedVector and CompressedVectorNode) -> Extracts Binary Data

    E57Parser emits parsingFinished(success, detailed_message, points)

    MainWindow::onParsingFinished receives signal -> If success, calls PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud(points). If failure, displays detailed_message.

    PointCloudViewerWidget renders points or MainWindow shows error.

5. List of Files being Created

No new source code files are anticipated for creation in this sprint. The focus is on refactoring and enhancing existing files.

    Modified Files:

        src/e57parser.h

        src/e57parser.cpp

        src/mainwindow.cpp (potentially minor changes to ensure full error messages are shown)

        tests/test_e57parser.cpp (significant updates for new test cases)

    New Test Files (Data):

        File 5: compressedvector_uncompressed_data.e57

            Purpose: A valid E57 file where uncompressed XYZ float points are described via a points type="CompressedVector" element and a CompressedVectorNode in the codecs section.

            Contents: Valid E57 header, XML with CompressedVector structure pointing to an uncompressed binary section with known point data.

            Relationships: Used by tests/test_e57parser.cpp and for manual testing.

        File 6: malformed_compressedvector.e57

            Purpose: Test error handling for invalid CompressedVector or CompressedVectorNode structures.

            Contents: Valid E57 header, XML with a CompressedVector structure that is missing required child elements or attributes (e.g., CompressedVectorNode missing recordCount).

            Relationships: Used by tests/test_e57parser.cpp.

6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section. The overall acceptance for the sprint is the successful completion of the "Definition of Done" as stated in the PRD for Sprint 1.2.)

Sprint 1.2 Definition of Done (from PRD):

    Can load E57 files with typical CompressedVector structures containing uncompressed XYZ data.

    Failures are clearly reported with specific error messages.

7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
The primary testing tool will be Google Test framework (gtest). Manual testing with newly created sample E57 files will be crucial.
8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The point data within the binary sections referenced by CompressedVectorNode is uncompressed and consists of cartesianX, cartesianY, cartesianZ single-precision floats for this sprint.

        The binarySection attribute/element within CompressedVectorNode can be resolved to a file offset without highly complex indirect lookups for this sprint (e.g., it's a direct offset, or a simple string identifier that maps to a section immediately after XML or at a known fixed location for test files). Further investigation on standard ways to resolve binarySection string identifiers to physical offsets is noted as a potential complexity.

        Developers continue to have access to ASTM E57 standard documentation.

    Dependencies:

        Successful completion of Sprint 1.1 backlog items.

        Qt 6 framework (Core, Gui, Widgets, Xml).

        Google Test framework.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

(Referencing the main PRD. For this sprint, the most relevant are):

    NFR2 (Usability): Error messages must be significantly more specific and helpful.

    NFR3 (Maintainability): Code handling CompressedVector logic should be clear and well-documented.

    NFR4 (Robustness): Parser should correctly identify and report malformed CompressedVector structures.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 1.2 is critical for advancing the E57Parser's capability to handle a broader range of real-world E57 files by correctly interpreting CompressedVector metadata. Simultaneously, improving error reporting will greatly enhance the application's usability when encountering problematic files.
