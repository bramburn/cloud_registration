Sprint 2.3 Backlog: UI/UX Improvements for Loading Feedback

Sprint Goal: To enhance the user experience during the point cloud loading process by refining progress reporting, improving visual feedback within the viewer, and ensuring status bar messages are consistently clear and helpful.
1. Introduction

This document outlines the backlog items for Sprint 2.3 of Phase 2 for the "Robust Point Cloud Loading (.e57 & .las)" project. With the core parsing logic and initial performance optimizations in place, this sprint focuses on improving the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) related to file loading. Clearer feedback during potentially long operations and better indication of success or failure will make the application more user-friendly. This directly addresses PRD requirement NFR2 (Usability).
2. User Stories
User Story 1 (Sprint 2.3): Refine Progress Reporting Granularity

    As a user,

    I want to see more granular and accurate progress updates when loading large point cloud files,

    So that I have a better understanding of how long the process might take and that the application hasn't frozen.

        Description: Currently, progress updates might be infrequent or only represent large stages of parsing. This story aims to break down the progress reporting emitted by E57Parser and LasParser into smaller, more frequent updates. For instance, progress could be updated after parsing the header, after parsing the XML (for E57), and then incrementally during the reading/decompression of point data chunks.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.3.1.1: Analyze E57Parser::parse and LasParser::parse methods to identify logical sub-stages where progress can be reported. Examples:

                E57: Header parsed (e.g., 5%), XML parsed (e.g., 15%), Binary section X of Y processed.

                LAS: Header parsed (e.g., 5%), Point block X of Y processed.

            Task 2.3.1.2: Modify the parsers to emit progressUpdated(int percentage) signals more frequently during these sub-stages. The percentage should reflect the estimated completion of the entire loading process.

            Task 2.3.1.3: Ensure the calculation of percentage is reasonably accurate based on file size, number of points, or other available metrics. For operations like XML parsing whose duration is hard to predict, assign a fixed percentage block.

            Task 2.3.1.4: Update MainWindow::onParsingProgressUpdated to smoothly update the QProgressDialog.

            Task 2.3.1.5: Test with various file sizes to ensure progress updates feel responsive and representative.

        References between Files:

            src/e57parser.h, src/e57parser.cpp: Modifications to emit progressUpdated more frequently.

            src/lasparser.h, src/lasparser.cpp: Modifications to emit progressUpdated more frequently.

            src/mainwindow.h, src/mainwindow.cpp: onParsingProgressUpdated slot and QProgressDialog usage.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When loading a large E57 or LAS file:

                The QProgressDialog updates its progress bar at least 3-5 times during the loading process (excluding initial 0% and final 100%).

                The progress updates appear reasonably paced and not stuck at one value for an excessively long time before jumping.

                The text in the QProgressDialog could potentially also update to reflect the current stage (e.g., "Parsing XML...", "Reading point data..."). (Stretch goal for this task).

        Testing Plan:

            Manual Integration Tests:

                Test Case 2.3.1.A: Load a large E57 file (uncompressed).

                    Test Data: large_e57_uncompressed_10M.e57.

                    Expected Result: Progress dialog updates multiple times, reflecting stages like header parsing, XML parsing, and point data reading.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing, observation of QProgressDialog.

                Test Case 2.3.1.B: Load a large E57 file (with implemented codec).

                    Test Data: large_e57_codec1_10M.e57.

                    Expected Result: Progress dialog updates multiple times, reflecting stages including decompression.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

                Test Case 2.3.1.C: Load a large LAS file.

                    Test Data: large_las_pdrf1_10M.las.

                    Expected Result: Progress dialog updates multiple times, reflecting header parsing and incremental point data reading.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

User Story 2 (Sprint 2.3): Improve Visual Feedback in Viewer During Loading and on Failure

    As a user,

    I want the main point cloud viewing area to provide clear visual feedback when a file is being loaded and if a loading attempt fails,

    So that I'm not looking at a blank or stale view and wondering about the application's state.

        Description: When a file is loading, especially a large one, the PointCloudViewerWidget might remain blank or show old data until the new data is ready. If loading fails, it might also remain blank or show old data. This story aims to implement visual cues within the viewer itself, such as a "Loading..." message/spinner or a "Load Failed: [Error Details]" overlay.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.3.2.1: Design the visual states for the PointCloudViewerWidget:

                "Idle/Empty" state (current blank).

                "Loading" state (e.g., centered text "Loading point cloud..." with a simple animated spinner or progress indicator if feasible without major OpenGL changes).

                "Load Failed" state (e.g., centered text "Failed to load file: [brief error message]", perhaps with an icon).

            Task 2.3.2.2: Add state variables to PointCloudViewerWidget to track its current display mode (e.g., enum ViewerState { Idle, Loading, DisplayingData, LoadFailed }).

            Task 2.3.2.3: Modify PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL() to render these different states. This might involve:

                For text overlays: Using QPainter on top of the OpenGL context (if simple) or rendering text using OpenGL (more complex, but better integration). QOpenGLWidget::paintOverlayGL could be an option.

                Clearing the previous point cloud data before showing "Loading" or "Load Failed".

            Task 2.3.2.4: Modify MainWindow to signal state changes to PointCloudViewerWidget:

                When onOpenFileClicked is called: Tell viewer to enter "Loading" state.

                In onParsingFinished: If success and points available, tell viewer to enter "DisplayingData" state (as it does now by calling loadPointCloud). If failure, tell viewer to enter "Load Failed" state, passing a brief error message.

            Task 2.3.2.5: Ensure that initiating a new file load clears any previous "Load Failed" message and transitions to "Loading".

        References between Files:

            src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h, src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: Major changes for state management and paintGL/paintOverlayGL rendering.

            src/mainwindow.h, src/mainwindow.cpp: To signal state changes to the viewer.

            Potentially new simple UI assets (e.g., a spinner icon if used).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When a file load is initiated:

                The PointCloudViewerWidget clears any previous data/messages and displays a "Loading..." visual cue.

            If a file load fails:

                The PointCloudViewerWidget clears any "Loading..." cue and displays a "Load Failed: [Specific Error Summary]" visual cue.

                This "Load Failed" message remains until a new load is attempted or the view is otherwise cleared.

            If a file load succeeds:

                The "Loading..." cue is replaced by the point cloud data.

            The visual cues are clear, legible, and do not obstruct other UI elements unnecessarily.

        Testing Plan:

            Manual Integration Tests:

                Test Case 2.3.2.A: Initiate loading of a large valid file.

                    Test Data: large_las_pdrf1_10M.las.

                    Expected Result: Viewer shows "Loading..." message. Once loaded, points are displayed.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

                Test Case 2.3.2.B: Initiate loading of an invalid file.

                    Test Data: corrupt_header.e57.

                    Expected Result: Viewer shows "Loading..." message, then transitions to "Load Failed: [Error Summary]" message.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

                Test Case 2.3.2.C: Load an invalid file, then immediately try to load a valid file.

                    Test Data: corrupt_header.e57, then simple_uncompressed.e57.

                    Expected Result: Viewer shows "Load Failed", then transitions to "Loading...", then displays points from the valid file.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

User Story 3 (Sprint 2.3): Ensure Consistent and Helpful Status Bar Messages

    As a user,

    I want the application's status bar to provide consistent, clear, and helpful messages throughout the file loading lifecycle and during normal operation,

    So that I always have a quick reference for the application's current status or the result of the last major action.

        Description: The status bar is a key area for providing quick feedback. This story involves reviewing and standardizing the messages displayed in the status bar by MainWindow related to file loading (idle, opening, loading, success, failure, metadata display) and other operations.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Task 2.3.3.1: Review all current uses of statusBar()->showMessage() in MainWindow.cpp.

            Task 2.3.3.2: Define a standard set of status bar messages for different states/events:

                Idle: "Ready" or "Ready to load point cloud files."

                File dialog open: (No change needed, system handles this)

                File selected, parsing started: "Loading [filename]..."

                LAS Header Parsed: "File: [filename], Points: [N], BBox: (...)-(...)" (current format is good, ensure consistency).

                Parsing successful (E57 or LAS points loaded): "Successfully loaded [filename]: [N] points."

                Parsing failed: "Failed to load [filename]: [Brief Error Summary]." (Should match viewer's failed message summary).

                View changed (Top, Left, etc.): "Switched to [View Name] view." (current format is good).

            Task 2.3.3.3: Update MainWindow.cpp to use these standardized messages consistently at the appropriate points (e.g., in onOpenFileClicked, onParsingFinished, onLasHeaderParsed, view change slots).

            Task 2.3.3.4: Ensure error messages in the status bar are concise summaries, with more details available in the QMessageBox (as currently implemented).

            Task 2.3.3.5: Consider message timeout for temporary messages (e.g., "Switched to Top View" might disappear after a few seconds, reverting to "Ready" or file info). Permanent messages like file info or load failure should persist.

        References between Files:

            src/mainwindow.h, src/mainwindow.cpp: Primary file for status bar message updates.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Status bar messages are consistent with the defined standards for all relevant application states and actions.

            Error messages in the status bar are brief but informative summaries of the failure.

            Metadata display for LAS files in the status bar is clear and correct.

            Status messages update appropriately throughout the file loading lifecycle.

        Testing Plan:

            Manual Integration Tests:

                Test Case 2.3.3.A: Perform a sequence of actions: app start, open valid LAS, open valid E57, open invalid LAS, open invalid E57, change views.

                    Test Data: Various valid and invalid LAS/E57 files.

                    Expected Result: Observe status bar at each step. Messages should match the defined standards and update correctly.

                    Testing Tool: Manual application testing.

3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)
4. References between Files

    src/mainwindow.h, src/mainwindow.cpp: Central for managing QProgressDialog, status bar, and signaling viewer state.

    src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h, src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp: For implementing new visual states ("Loading", "Load Failed").

    src/e57parser.cpp, src/lasparser.cpp: For emitting more granular progress updates.

Data Flows:

    Parsers emit progressUpdated -> MainWindow updates QProgressDialog.

    MainWindow (on file open) -> PointCloudViewerWidget (set "Loading" state).

    Parsers emit parsingFinished -> MainWindow -> PointCloudViewerWidget (set "DisplayingData" or "Load Failed" state).

    MainWindow updates statusBar() at various stages.

5. List of Files being Created

No new major source code files are anticipated. UI elements for the viewer states might be simple primitives or require small helper functions.

    Modified Files:

        src/e57parser.cpp

        src/lasparser.cpp

        src/mainwindow.h (potentially new slots/signals for viewer state)

        src/mainwindow.cpp

        src/pointcloudviewerwidget.h (new state enum, methods to set state)

        src/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp (implement rendering for new states)

    New Assets (Potentially):

        If a graphical spinner is used for the "Loading" state in the viewer, a small image or SVG asset might be needed (though text-based is simpler).

6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)

Sprint 2.3 Definition of Done (from PRD):

    Progress reporting during parsing is more granular and informative.

    The PointCloudViewerWidget provides clear visual feedback during loading and on failure (e.g., "Loading..." message or "Load Failed" overlay).

    Status bar messages are consistently helpful and accurately reflect the application state.

    Overall user experience during file loading is improved.

7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.) This sprint is heavily reliant on manual UI/UX testing and observation, supported by integration tests that trigger different loading states.
8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        The existing QProgressDialog is sufficient for displaying refined progress, and MainWindow can manage its updates effectively.

        Implementing simple text/basic shape overlays in PointCloudViewerWidget (e.g., using QPainter via paintOverlayGL or basic OpenGL text rendering) is feasible within the sprint. Complex animated graphics for loading states are out of scope unless very simple.

        The error information provided by parsers (from previous sprints) is detailed enough to provide meaningful summaries for "Load Failed" messages.

    Dependencies:

        Stable and functional E57 and LAS parsers from Phase 1 and Sprints 2.1, 2.2.

        Qt 6 framework (Core, Gui, Widgets, OpenGL).

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    NFR2 (Usability): This is the primary focus of the sprint. All changes should directly contribute to a more intuitive and less confusing user experience during file loading.

    Performance (NFR1): UI updates for loading feedback should be lightweight and not introduce noticeable performance degradation to the loading process itself or the application's responsiveness. For example, a "Loading..." animation in the viewer should not consume excessive CPU.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 2.3 aims to significantly polish the user experience of the point cloud loading feature. By providing clearer, more granular, and contextually appropriate feedback, the application will feel more professional, responsive, and trustworthy to the user, especially when dealing with potentially time-consuming operations or problematic files.
