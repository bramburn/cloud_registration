# Sprint 1 Backlog: E57 Library Integration - Setup & Basic File Reading

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 31, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 Library Integration (prd_libe57_integration)
**Sprint Goal:** Successfully integrate the chosen E57 library (libE57Format) into the project's build system, and develop a basic wrapper class capable of opening E57 files and reading fundamental header metadata, with initial error handling for file operations.

## 1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint 1 of the "E57 Library Integration" project. The primary focus of this sprint is to lay the groundwork for replacing the custom E57 parser. This involves selecting and integrating the `libE57Format` library, ensuring the project can compile and link against it, and creating an initial C++ wrapper that can perform basic file opening operations and retrieve top-level metadata from an E57 file. Robust error handling for these initial operations is also a key objective. This sprint directly addresses Tasks 1-4 outlined in "Sprint 1: Library Setup & Basic File Reading (2 Weeks)" of the PRD.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story 1: Seamless E57 Library Build Integration

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `libE57Format` library to be correctly integrated into our project's build system (CMake with vcpkg),
* **So that** I can compile and link the application against the library without issues, enabling further development of E57 parsing capabilities.
    * **Description**: This story focuses on the foundational step of making the `libE57Format` library available to the project. It involves configuring the package manager (vcpkg) to fetch and build `libE57Format` and its dependencies (like Xerces-C), and updating the CMake build scripts to correctly find and link the library. The outcome is a development environment where `libE57Format` headers can be included and its functions called.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 1.1.1**: Confirm `libE57Format` (specifically a well-maintained fork like `asmaloney/libE57Format`) as the chosen library.
        * **Task 1.1.2**: Set up vcpkg for the project if not already in use. Create or update `vcpkg.json` manifest to include `libe57format` as a dependency.
            * *Input*: Project structure.
            * *Output*: `vcpkg.json` file.
            * *Reference Code (vcpkg.json)*:
                ```json
                {
                  "name": "cloud-registration-app",
                  "version-string": "0.1.0",
                  "dependencies": [
                    "libe57format"
                  ]
                }
                ```
        * **Task 1.1.3**: Configure CMake (`CMakeLists.txt`) to use the vcpkg toolchain file and find the `libE57Format` package.
            * *Input*: Existing `CMakeLists.txt`.
            * *Output*: Modified `CMakeLists.txt`.
            * *Reference Code (CMakeLists.txt)*:
                ```cmake
                cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
                project(CloudRegistrationApp LANGUAGES CXX)

                set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17) # Or your project's C++ standard
                set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

                # Ensure CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE is set when configuring CMake
                # e.g., cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path-to-vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
                find_package(E57Format CONFIG REQUIRED)

                # Example target linking
                # add_executable(CloudRegistrationApp src/main.cpp ...)
                # target_link_libraries(CloudRegistrationApp PRIVATE E57Format)
                ```
        * **Task 1.1.4**: Create a minimal C++ test program (`test_libe57_linkage.cpp`) that includes `libE57Format` headers and attempts a trivial library call (e.g., getting library version) to verify successful linking.
            * *Input*: Basic C++ compiler.
            * *Output*: Compilable and runnable test program.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `CMakeLists.txt` will depend on `vcpkg.json` (implicitly via vcpkg toolchain).
        * `test_libe57_linkage.cpp` will include headers from `libE57Format`.
        * The main application target in `CMakeLists.txt` will eventually link against `E57Format`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The project successfully compiles and links against the `libE57Format` library without errors on all target development platforms.
        2.  The minimal test program (`test_libe57_linkage.cpp`) executes and confirms library linkage (e.g., prints library version).
        3.  Dependencies of `libE57Format` (like Xerces-C) are correctly resolved by vcpkg.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 1.1.1**: Compile the project after CMake and vcpkg setup.
            * **Test Data**: N/A (build process test).
            * **Expected Result**: Successful compilation and linking of all project targets.
            * **Testing Tool**: CMake, C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, MSVC, Clang), vcpkg.
        * **Test Case 1.1.2**: Run `test_libe57_linkage.cpp`.
            * **Test Data**: N/A.
            * **Expected Result**: Program executes, prints `libE57Format` version or other confirmation, and exits cleanly.
            * **Testing Tool**: Execution of the compiled test program.

### User Story 2: Basic E57 File Opening and Header Metadata Retrieval

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** to create an initial C++ wrapper class (`E57ParserLib`) that uses `libE57Format` to open a given E57 file and read its basic header metadata (e.g., GUID, E57 version),
* **So that** the application can confirm file validity and access top-level file information, with basic error handling for file open operations.
    * **Description**: This story involves creating the initial structure of the new E57 parser. This class will encapsulate `libE57Format` calls. The first functionality will be to open an E57 file in read mode and extract some fundamental information from the E57 root structure. It must also handle potential exceptions thrown by `libE57Format` if the file cannot be opened or is not a valid E57 file.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 1.2.1**: Define the interface for the new parser class (e.g., `E57ParserLib.h`, potentially based on `src/e57parser_libe57_integration.h`). Include methods for opening a file and getting basic metadata and last error.
            * *Input*: Design requirements for the parser.
            * *Output*: Header file for the new parser.
        * **Task 1.2.2**: Implement the file opening mechanism in `E57ParserLib.cpp` using `e57::ImageFile(filePath, "r")`.
            * *Input*: File path string.
            * *Output*: An opened `e57::ImageFile` instance or an error indication.
            * *Reference Code (Opening File)*:
                ```cpp
                // In E57ParserLib::openFile(const std::string& filePath)
                // e57::ImageFile* imf = nullptr;
                // try {
                //     imf = new e57::ImageFile(filePath, "r");
                //     if (!imf->isOpen()) { /* handle error */ }
                //     // Store imf or rootNode for later use
                // } catch (e57::E57Exception& ex) { /* handle error */ }
                ```
        * **Task 1.2.3**: Implement functionality to read and return file-level metadata such as the E57 file GUID and E57 standard version (e.g., from `imf->root()` and `imf->fileVersionMajor()/Minor()`).
            * *Input*: Opened `e57::ImageFile` instance.
            * *Output*: Strings/values for GUID and version.
            * *Reference Code (Reading GUID)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode rootNode = imf->root();
                // if (rootNode.isDefined("guid") && rootNode.get("guid").type() == e57::E57_STRING) {
                //     e57::StringNode guidNode = static_cast<e57::StringNode>(rootNode.get("guid"));
                //     std::string fileGuid = guidNode.value();
                //     // ...
                // }
                ```
        * **Task 1.2.4**: Implement basic error handling for `e57::E57Exception` during file opening. Store error messages for retrieval by `getLastError()`.
            * *Input*: `e57::E57Exception` object.
            * *Output*: Error message string stored in the parser class.
            * *Reference Code (Error Handling)*:
                ```cpp
                // catch (e57::E57Exception& ex) {
                //     std::stringstream ss;
                //     ex.report(ss); // Get detailed report
                //     m_lastError = ss.str(); // Store it
                //     // Optionally, simplify for user-facing message
                // }
                ```
        * **Task 1.2.5**: Implement a method to get the count of `Data3D` (scan) sections in the E57 file.
            * *Input*: Opened `e57::ImageFile` instance.
            * *Output*: Integer count of scans.
            * *Reference Code (Scan Count)*:
                ```cpp
                // e57::StructureNode rootNode = imf->root();
                // if (rootNode.isDefined("/data3D")) {
                //     e57::VectorNode data3DVectorNode = static_cast<e57::VectorNode>(rootNode.get("/data3D"));
                //     int64_t scanCount = data3DVectorNode.childCount();
                //     // ...
                // }
                ```
    * **References between Files**:
        * `E57ParserLib.cpp` will include `E57ParserLib.h` and `e57/E57Foundation.h`.
        * `MainWindow.cpp` (in future sprints) will include `E57ParserLib.h` and instantiate `E57ParserLib`.
        * Unit test files will include `E57ParserLib.h`.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The `E57ParserLib` class can successfully open a valid E57 file.
        2.  The parser can retrieve and log/return the E57 file's GUID.
        3.  The parser can retrieve and log/return the E57 standard version the file conforms to.
        4.  The parser can retrieve and log/return the number of scans (`Data3D` entries) in the file.
        5.  If an invalid or non-existent file path is provided, the parser catches the `e57::E57Exception` and stores an appropriate error message.
        6.  The `getLastError()` method returns the correct error message upon failure.
        7.  The `E57ParserLib` properly closes the E57 file and releases resources, even in case of errors.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 1.2.1**: Test opening a known valid E57 file.
            * **Test Data**: A simple, valid E57 file (e.g., `sample/bunnyDouble.e57` or a minimal test E57 file).
            * **Expected Result**: File opens successfully. GUID, E57 version, and scan count are correctly read and match expected values for the test file. `getLastError()` is empty.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test framework, custom test application.
        * **Test Case 1.2.2**: Test opening a non-existent E57 file.
            * **Test Data**: Path to a file that does not exist.
            * **Expected Result**: File opening fails. `getLastError()` returns a message indicating file not found or open error. `e57::E57Exception` is caught.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test framework.
        * **Test Case 1.2.3**: Test opening a corrupted or non-E57 file.
            * **Test Data**: A text file renamed to `.e57` or a deliberately corrupted E57 file.
            * **Expected Result**: File opening fails. `getLastError()` returns a message indicating invalid E57 format or parsing error. `e57::E57Exception` is caught.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test framework.

## 3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)

## 4. References between Files

* **`CMakeLists.txt`**: Will be modified to include and link `libE57Format`.
* **`vcpkg.json`** (or vcpkg integration in CMake): Will specify `libe57format` dependency.
* **`src/e57parser_lib.h`** (New or Refactored): Interface for the new E57 parser wrapper. This might replace or heavily modify `src/e57parser.h` and `src/e57parser_libe57_integration.h`.
* **`src/e57parser_lib.cpp`** (New or Refactored): Implementation of the wrapper using `libE57Format`. This might replace or heavily modify `src/e57parser.cpp` and `src/e57parser_libe57_integration.cpp`.
* **`src/main.cpp`** (and `MainWindow.cpp` in later sprints): Will eventually use the new `E57ParserLib`.
* **`tests/test_e57parser_lib.cpp`** (New): Unit tests for the new `E57ParserLib`.
* **`libE57Format` headers** (e.g., `e57/E57Foundation.h`, `e57/E57Exception.h`): Will be included by `e57parser_lib.cpp`.

**Data Flows (Conceptual for this Sprint):**
1.  Application (or test case) provides a file path to `E57ParserLib::openFile()`.
2.  `E57ParserLib` calls `new e57::ImageFile(filePath, "r")`.
3.  `libE57Format` attempts to open and parse the E57 file header and XML section.
4.  If successful, `E57ParserLib` accesses `imf->root()` to get metadata (GUID, version, scan count).
5.  If an error occurs, `libE57Format` throws `e57::E57Exception`.
6.  `E57ParserLib` catches the exception and stores error information.
7.  Application (or test case) retrieves metadata or error status from `E57ParserLib`.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint 1 is:
1.  The `libE57Format` library is successfully integrated into the project build system and the project compiles without errors.
2.  The new `E57ParserLib` class can open valid E57 files using `libE57Format`.
3.  `E57ParserLib` can extract and return basic file-level metadata: file GUID, E57 standard version, and the number of scans (`Data3D` sections).
4.  `E57ParserLib` correctly handles and reports errors (via `getLastError()`) when attempting to open non-existent or invalid E57 files, by catching `e57::E57Exception`.
5.  All resources (e.g., `e57::ImageFile`) are properly managed and released.

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Build Verification Tests**: Ensure the project compiles and links cleanly after library integration.
* **Unit Tests (Google Test)**: Focus on the `E57ParserLib` class.
    * Test successful opening of various known-good minimal E57 files.
    * Test retrieval of GUID, version, scan count from these files.
    * Test error handling with non-existent files.
    * Test error handling with malformed/corrupted E57 files (header-level corruption initially).
    * Test resource cleanup (e.g., using mocks or observing behavior if possible).
* **Manual Smoke Tests**: Manually run a small test application that uses `E57ParserLib` to open a sample E57 file and print its metadata to the console.

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint 1:**
* A minimal, valid E57 file (can be created programmatically or a small standard sample).
* A corrupted E57 file (e.g., header tampered).
* A non-E57 file (e.g., a text file renamed to `.e57`).

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  `libE57Format` (specifically a maintained fork like `asmaloney/libE57Format`) is the chosen library for E57 parsing.
    2.  `vcpkg` will be used for managing C++ dependencies, including `libE57Format` and Xerces-C.
    3.  The project uses CMake as its build system.
    4.  The target development environment(s) support C++17 (or the version required by the chosen `libE57Format` fork).
    5.  Developers have access to the ASTM E57 standard documentation for reference.
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  C++ Compiler (supporting C++17 or as required).
    2.  CMake (version 3.15 or higher).
    3.  `vcpkg` package manager.
    4.  `libE57Format` library (and its transitive dependencies like Xerces-C).
    5.  Google Test framework (for unit tests).
    6.  Qt 6 framework (Core module for `QDebug`, `QString`, etc., if `E57ParserLib` uses them, though direct Qt dependency in the core parser library should be minimized if aiming for broader reusability).

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1 (Build Stability)**: The integration of `libE57Format` must not destabilize the project's build process. Builds should remain reliable and reproducible.
* **NFR2 (Maintainability)**: The `E57ParserLib` wrapper code should be well-structured, clearly documented, and easy to understand to facilitate future enhancements.
* **NFR3 (Performance - Initial)**: While full performance optimization is for later sprints, the basic file opening and header reading operations should not introduce excessive delays for typical E57 files. Initial performance should be acceptable (e.g., opening a file and reading header metadata within a few seconds).
* **NFR4 (Error Reporting Clarity - Basic)**: Error messages from `libE57Format` related to file opening should be captured and made available in a way that is understandable for developers during this initial phase.

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint 1 is foundational for the E57 library integration effort. Successfully completing these tasks will provide a stable base upon which all subsequent E57 data extraction and processing features will be built. Key outcomes include a working build environment with `libE57Format` and a rudimentary parser class capable of interacting with E57 files at a basic level, including essential error detection.
