# Sprint 3 Backlog: E57 Library Integration - Intensity, Color, and CompressedVector Handling

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 31, 2025
**Associated PRD:** E57 Library Integration (prd_libe57_integration)
**Sprint Goal:** Enhance `E57ParserLib` to extract optional point attributes (intensity and RGB color) if present in the E57 file's prototype, normalize these values appropriately, and ensure robust handling of data retrieval from `CompressedVectorNode` structures using `libE57Format` for these attributes alongside XYZ coordinates.

## 1. Introduction

This document details the backlog items for Sprint 3 of the "E57 Library Integration" project. Following the successful extraction of XYZ point data in Sprint 2, this sprint aims to enrich the point cloud data by extracting intensity and RGB color information. It also focuses on ensuring that the `E57ParserLib` robustly uses `libE57Format`'s mechanisms for reading these attributes from `CompressedVectorNode` elements, including proper buffer setup and data normalization. This sprint directly addresses the tasks outlined for "Sprint 3: Intensity, Color, and CompressedVector Handling (2 Weeks)" in the main PRD.

## 2. User Stories

### User Story 1: Extract and Normalize Intensity Data

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57ParserLib` to detect and extract intensity data for each point if it's defined in the E57 file's point prototype, and normalize it to a standard range (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0),
* **So that** the application can utilize or visualize point intensity, providing richer data representation.
    * **Description**: This story involves extending the prototype inspection logic (from Sprint 2) to identify an `intensity` field. If present, `SourceDestBuffer`s will be configured to read this data. The raw intensity values (which can be `FloatNode`, `IntegerNode`, or `ScaledIntegerNode`) will be read and then normalized, typically using the `intensityLimits` found in the `Data3D` header, to a consistent range (e.g., 0.0f to 1.0f) for application use.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 3.1.1**: Enhance prototype inspection in `E57ParserLib` (Task 2.1.3) to specifically check for an "intensity" field. Determine its E57 data type (`FloatNode`, `IntegerNode`, `ScaledIntegerNode`) and precision.
            * *Input*: `e57::StructureNode pointPrototype`.
            * *Output*: Information about the presence and type of the intensity field.
        * **Task 3.1.2**: If intensity field exists, add an appropriate `e57::SourceDestBuffer` to the `sdbufs` vector for reading intensity data. The C++ buffer type should be chosen based on the E57 type and whether raw or library-converted/scaled values are read (e.g., `float` if `doConversion=true` and `doScaling=true` are used for `ScaledIntegerNode`).
            * *Input*: Prototype information, `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK`.
            * *Output*: `sdbufs` vector augmented with intensity buffer.
            * *Reference Code (Adding Intensity Buffer)*:
                ```cpp
                // std::vector<float> intensityBuffer_f(POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK); // Assuming reading as float
                // if (pointPrototype.isDefined("intensity")) {
                //    e57::Node intensityProtoNode = pointPrototype.get("intensity");
                //    if (intensityProtoNode.type() == e57::E57_SCALED_INTEGER ||
                //        intensityProtoNode.type() == e57::E57_INTEGER ||
                //        intensityProtoNode.type() == e57::E57_FLOAT) {
                //        // Request conversion to float, and scaling if it's a ScaledIntegerNode
                //        sdbufs.emplace_back(imf, "intensity", intensityBuffer_f.data(), POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK, true, true, sizeof(float));
                //        // Store flag: hasIntensity = true;
                //    }
                // }
                ```
        * **Task 3.1.3**: Modify the point reading loop (Task 2.2.3) to process the intensity data from its C++ buffer after each `reader.read()` call.
        * **Task 3.1.4**: Implement normalization logic for intensity values. This involves:
            * Reading `intensityMinimum` and `intensityMaximum` from the `Data3D` header's `intensityLimits` `StructureNode`.
            * Applying the formula: `normalizedIntensity = (rawValue - intensityMinimum) / (intensityMaximum - intensityMinimum)`.
            * Clamping the result to the target range (e.g., 0.0f to 1.0f).
            * Handle cases where `intensityLimits` are missing or `intensityMinimum == intensityMaximum`.
            * *Input*: Raw/scaled intensity value from buffer, `intensityLimits` from `Data3D` header.
            * *Output*: Normalized intensity value (e.g., 0.0f to 1.0f).
            * *Reference Code (Normalization)*:
                ```cpp
                // float rawIntensity = intensityBuffer_f[ptIdx]; // Value from SourceDestBuffer
                // double intensityMinFromFile = 0.0, intensityMaxFromFile = 1.0; // Defaults
                // bool limitsAvailable = false;
                // // ... (Code to get intensityMinFromFile, intensityMaxFromFile from scanHeaderNode.get("intensityLimits") - see Appendix A.1)
                //
                // float normalizedIntensity = rawIntensity;
                // if (limitsAvailable && (intensityMaxFromFile - intensityMinFromFile > 1e-6)) {
                //     normalizedIntensity = (rawIntensity - static_cast<float>(intensityMinFromFile)) / static_cast<float>(intensityMaxFromFile - intensityMinFromFile);
                // }
                // normalizedIntensity = std::max(0.0f, std::min(1.0f, normalizedIntensity)); // Clamp
                // currentPoint.intensity = normalizedIntensity;
                // currentPoint.hasIntensity = true;
                ```
        * **Task 3.1.5**: Store the normalized intensity data alongside XYZ coordinates (e.g., extend `PointFullData` struct or the application's point data structure).
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57parser_lib.cpp`: Core implementation for intensity extraction and normalization.
        * `src/e57parser_lib.h`: Update parser class definition if new members are needed to store intensity-related prototype info or flags.
        * `tests/test_e57parser_lib.cpp`: New tests for intensity.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The parser correctly identifies the presence of an `intensity` field in the E57 prototype.
        2.  Intensity values are read correctly from the E57 file.
        3.  Intensity values are normalized to a standard range (e.g., 0.0f to 1.0f) using `intensityLimits` if available.
        4.  If `intensity` field is not present, the parser handles it gracefully (e.g., intensity data is marked as unavailable).
        5.  The extracted and normalized intensity data is correctly associated with its corresponding XYZ point.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 3.1.1**: Parse an E57 file containing an `intensity` field (e.g., as `ScaledIntegerNode`).
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with known intensity values and defined `intensityLimits`.
            * **Expected Result**: Intensity values are extracted and correctly normalized.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test, debugger.
        * **Test Case 3.1.2**: Parse an E57 file where `intensity` is a `FloatNode` (possibly already normalized).
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with intensity as floats (e.g., 0.0-1.0 range).
            * **Expected Result**: Intensity values are read correctly. Normalization should still clamp if `intensityLimits` suggest a different range or if values are outside 0-1.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 3.1.3**: Parse an E57 file that does *not* contain an `intensity` field.
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with only XYZ coordinates.
            * **Expected Result**: Parser indicates intensity is not available for points. No errors related to missing intensity.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 3.1.4**: Parse an E57 file with `intensityLimits` where min equals max.
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with `intensityLimits/intensityMinimum` == `intensityLimits/intensityMaximum`.
            * **Expected Result**: Normalization handles this gracefully (e.g., all normalized intensities become 0 or 0.5, or an error/warning is logged).
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.

### User Story 2: Extract and Normalize RGB Color Data

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57ParserLib` to detect and extract RGB color data (e.g., `colorRed`, `colorGreen`, `colorBlue` fields) for each point if defined in the E57 prototype, and normalize them to a standard range (e.g., 0-255 for `uint8_t`),
* **So that** the application can display richly colored point clouds.
    * **Description**: Similar to intensity, this story involves identifying color fields in the prototype. `libE57Format` will be used to read these values. Common E57 representations include `IntegerNode` (e.g., 0-255 for 8-bit) or `ScaledIntegerNode` (e.g., 0-65535 for 16-bit, scaled to 0-1). The read values will be normalized to a consistent application range, typically `uint8_t` (0-255) per channel, using `colorLimits` from the `Data3D` header if necessary.
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 3.2.1**: Enhance prototype inspection to check for "colorRed", "colorGreen", and "colorBlue" fields and their E57 data types/precisions.
            * *Input*: `e57::StructureNode pointPrototype`.
            * *Output*: Information about presence and type of color fields.
        * **Task 3.2.2**: If color fields exist, add appropriate `e57::SourceDestBuffer` objects for each color channel. Choose C++ buffer types (e.g., `uint8_t` if target is 8-bit and library conversion is used, or a wider integer type if reading raw 16-bit values before manual normalization).
            * *Input*: Prototype information, `e57::ImageFile* imf`, `POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK`.
            * *Output*: `sdbufs` vector augmented with color channel buffers.
            * *Reference Code (Adding Color Buffer for `colorRed` as `uint8_t`)*:
                ```cpp
                // std::vector<uint8_t> rBuffer_u8(POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK);
                // if (pointPrototype.isDefined("colorRed")) {
                //    e57::Node rProtoNode = pointPrototype.get("colorRed");
                //    // Assuming colorRed is IntegerNode (0-255) or ScaledIntegerNode that can be converted to uint8_t
                //    if (rProtoNode.type() == e57::E57_INTEGER || rProtoNode.type() == e57::E57_SCALED_INTEGER) {
                //        sdbufs.emplace_back(imf, "colorRed", rBuffer_u8.data(), POINTS_PER_READ_BLOCK, true, true, sizeof(uint8_t));
                //        // Store flag: hasColorRed = true;
                //    }
                // }
                // // Similar for colorGreen, colorBlue
                ```
        * **Task 3.2.3**: Modify the point reading loop to process RGB data from their C++ buffers.
        * **Task 3.2.4**: Implement normalization logic for color values, if necessary. If `SourceDestBuffer` is configured to read directly into `uint8_t` with `doConversion=true, doScaling=true`, the library might handle much of the conversion from common E57 integer/scaled integer types (e.g., those representing 0-255 or 0-1 ranges). However, always check against `colorLimits` from `Data3D` header for final validation or scaling if the library's output isn't directly 0-255.
            * *Input*: Raw/scaled color channel value, `colorLimits` from `Data3D` header.
            * *Output*: Normalized color channel value (e.g., `uint8_t` 0-255).
        * **Task 3.2.5**: Store the normalized RGB values with the corresponding XYZ point.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57parser_lib.cpp`: Core implementation for color extraction and normalization.
        * `src/e57parser_lib.h`: Update parser class definition if new members are needed.
        * `tests/test_e57parser_lib.cpp`: New tests for color.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The parser correctly identifies `colorRed`, `colorGreen`, `colorBlue` fields in the prototype.
        2.  RGB color values are read correctly.
        3.  Color values are normalized to a standard range (e.g., `uint8_t` 0-255 per channel).
        4.  If color fields are not present, points are marked as having no color data.
        5.  Extracted color data is correctly associated with its XYZ point.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 3.2.1**: Parse an E57 file with 8-bit RGB color (e.g., stored as `IntegerNode` 0-255).
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with known 8-bit RGB values.
            * **Expected Result**: Color values are extracted correctly as `uint8_t` 0-255.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 3.2.2**: Parse an E57 file with 16-bit RGB color (e.g., `ScaledIntegerNode` 0-65535, scaled to 0-1 by library, then app maps to 0-255).
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with 16-bit RGB and appropriate scaling in prototype or `colorLimits`.
            * **Expected Result**: Color values are correctly read and normalized to `uint8_t` 0-255.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 3.2.3**: Parse an E57 file without color information.
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with only XYZ and/or intensity.
            * **Expected Result**: Parser indicates color is not available. No errors.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.

### User Story 3: Ensure Robust `CompressedVectorNode` Data Handling via `libE57Format`

* **As a developer,**
* **I want** the `E57ParserLib` to robustly utilize `libE57Format`'s `CompressedVectorReader` for accessing all configured point attributes (XYZ, Intensity, Color) from `CompressedVectorNode` elements,
* **So that** data extraction is reliable across various common E57 file structures where these attributes are defined within the node's prototype.
    * **Description**: This story ensures that the mechanisms developed in Sprint 2 for XYZ are correctly extended and applied for intensity and color, and that the overall interaction with `CompressedVectorNode` via `libE57Format` is sound. This includes verifying correct `SourceDestBuffer` setup for all requested attributes simultaneously and ensuring the read loop correctly populates all corresponding C++ buffers. `libE57Format` itself handles the "compressed" nature of the `CompressedVectorNode` (which is about efficient storage of many identical records, not necessarily data compression in the traditional sense for all fields).
    * **Actions to Undertake**:
        * **Task 3.3.1**: Review and confirm that the `std::vector<e57::SourceDestBuffer> sdbufs` is correctly populated with buffers for all requested and available fields (XYZ, and optionally intensity, colorRed, colorGreen, colorBlue) based on prototype inspection.
            * *Input*: Prototype information from User Stories 1 & 2.
            * *Output*: Correctly configured `sdbufs`.
        * **Task 3.3.2**: Verify that the `e57::CompressedVectorReader::read()` loop correctly populates all respective C++ data buffers (e.g., `xBuffer`, `yBuffer`, `zBuffer`, `intensityBuffer_f`, `rBuffer_u8`, etc.) in each iteration.
        * **Task 3.3.3**: Ensure that the application correctly processes data from all active buffers after each `read()` call, associating all attributes with the correct point index.
        * **Task 3.3.4**: Test with E57 files that have varying combinations of attributes (e.g., XYZ only; XYZ + Intensity; XYZ + Color; XYZ + Intensity + Color) to ensure flexibility.
    * **References between Files**:
        * `src/e57parser_lib.cpp`: Modifications to the core point reading loop.
    * **Acceptance Criteria**:
        1.  The parser can simultaneously read XYZ, intensity, and RGB color data if all are present in the prototype and requested.
        2.  The data in the C++ buffers for each attribute corresponds correctly to the point data being read.
        3.  The parser gracefully handles files where only a subset of these attributes (e.g., only XYZ, or XYZ+Intensity) is present in the `CompressedVectorNode` prototype.
        4.  The total number of points read for all attributes is consistent.
    * **Testing Plan**:
        * **Test Case 3.3.1**: Parse an E57 file containing XYZ, Intensity, and RGB Color.
            * **Test Data**: A comprehensive E57 test file with all attributes and known values.
            * **Expected Result**: All attributes are extracted correctly for each point.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 3.3.2**: Parse an E57 file with only XYZ and Intensity (no color).
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with XYZ and Intensity.
            * **Expected Result**: XYZ and Intensity are extracted. Color is correctly reported as unavailable.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.
        * **Test Case 3.3.3**: Parse an E57 file with only XYZ and Color (no intensity).
            * **Test Data**: E57 file with XYZ and Color.
            * **Expected Result**: XYZ and Color are extracted. Intensity is correctly reported as unavailable.
            * **Testing Tool**: Google Test.

## 3. Actions to Undertake

(Covered within each User Story's "Actions to Undertake" section.)

5.  Creates `CompressedVectorReader`.
6.  Loop:
    a.  `reader.read()` fills C++ buffers for XYZ, intensity, color.
    b.  Emits `progressUpdated`.
    c.  Converts XYZ doubles to floats.
    d.  Normalizes intensity (e.g., to 0-1 float).
    e.  Normalizes color (e.g., to 0-255 uint8_t per channel).
    f.  Appends all attributes to the application's point data structure.
7.  `reader.close()`.
8.  Emits `parsingFinished`.

    * **Relationships**: Tests `E57ParserLib`.

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

(Covered within each User Story's "Acceptance Criteria" section.)
The overall Definition of Done for Sprint 3 is:
1.  `E57ParserLib` can successfully read uncompressed intensity data from E57 files, normalize it, and associate it with the correct points.
2.  `E57ParserLib` can successfully read uncompressed RGB color data from E57 files, normalize it (typically to 0-255 per channel), and associate it with the correct points.
3.  The parser correctly identifies the presence and E57 types of intensity and color fields from the prototype.
4.  The `CompressedVectorReader` mechanism is robustly used to read all configured attributes (XYZ, intensity, color) simultaneously.
5.  The application gracefully handles E57 files that may be missing intensity or color data, or have them in various supported E57 types (Float, Integer, ScaledInteger).
6.  Unit tests are expanded to cover various scenarios of intensity and color data presence, types, and values.

## 7. Testing Plan

(Covered within each User Story's "Testing Plan" section.)
**Overall Sprint Testing Strategy:**
* **Unit Tests (Google Test)**:
    * Verify correct identification of intensity and color fields in various E57 prototypes.
    * Test `SourceDestBuffer` setup for intensity and color with different underlying E57 types (Float, Integer, ScaledInteger).
    * Validate the normalization logic for intensity (to 0-1 float) and color (to 0-255 uint8_t) using known input values and `intensityLimits`/`colorLimits`.
    * Test reading from E57 files containing:
        * XYZ only.
        * XYZ + Intensity.
        * XYZ + RGB Color.
        * XYZ + Intensity + RGB Color.
        * Intensity/Color stored as `FloatNode`.
        * Intensity/Color stored as `IntegerNode`.
        * Intensity/Color stored as `ScaledIntegerNode`.
    * Test behavior with missing `intensityLimits` or `colorLimits`.
* **Integration Tests (Conceptual for this sprint):**
    * Extend the test harness from Sprint 2. After `E57ParserLib` processes a file, the harness should now also be able to print/validate a sample of intensity and color values alongside XYZ coordinates.

**Test Data Requirements for Sprint 3:**
* E57 files with known intensity data (e.g., as `ScaledIntegerNode` with defined `intensityLimits`).
* E57 files with known 8-bit RGB color data (e.g., as `IntegerNode` 0-255 per channel).
* E57 files with known 16-bit RGB color data (e.g., as `ScaledIntegerNode` 0-65535, with scaling defined in prototype or `colorLimits`).
* E57 files containing a mix of attributes: XYZ + Intensity, XYZ + Color, XYZ + Intensity + Color.
* E57 files where intensity or color fields are defined as `FloatNode`.
* E57 files where `intensityLimits` or `colorLimits` are absent or have min=max.

## 8. Assumptions and Dependencies

* **Assumptions**:
    1.  Sprint 2 (XYZ Data Extraction) has been successfully completed. `E57ParserLib` can read and convert XYZ coordinates.
    2.  Intensity and color data in test E57 files are uncompressed fields within the `CompressedVectorNode`'s prototype.
    3.  The application's internal point data structure can be (or will be) extended to store normalized intensity (float) and RGB color (e.g., 3 x uint8_t).
    4.  `libE57Format`'s `doConversion=true` and `doScaling=true` flags for `SourceDestBuffer` will handle initial conversions from E57 types (like `ScaledIntegerNode`) to the C++ buffer types (e.g., `float` for intensity, `uint8_t` for color channels) effectively for common cases. Further application-level normalization based on `Data3D` limits will refine these.
* **Dependencies**:
    1.  Completed and functional `E57ParserLib` from Sprint 2.
    2.  `libE57Format` library correctly linked.
    3.  C++ Compiler, CMake, vcpkg.
    4.  Google Test framework.
    5.  Qt 6 framework (Core, Testlib).

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

* **NFR1 (Performance)**: Extracting additional attributes (intensity, color) should not disproportionately degrade the overall point cloud loading performance compared to XYZ-only extraction. The impact should be reasonable and primarily related to the additional data I/O and normalization computation.
* **NFR2 (Accuracy)**: Normalized intensity and color values must accurately reflect the source data within the defined target ranges (e.g., intensity 0.0-1.0, color channels 0-255).
* **NFR3 (Memory Management)**: Additional buffers for intensity and color should be managed efficiently, similar to XYZ buffers, to prevent excessive memory use, especially during block-wise reading.
* **NFR4 (Robustness)**: The parser must robustly handle files where intensity or color attributes are missing, malformed in the prototype, or have unexpected `intensityLimits`/`colorLimits` values, reporting errors or warnings appropriately without crashing.

## 10. Conclusion

Sprint 3 significantly enhances the value of the point cloud data loaded by the application by incorporating intensity and color attributes. This will enable richer visualizations and more sophisticated downstream processing. The focus remains on leveraging `libE57Format` effectively, ensuring correct interpretation of E57 prototypes for these additional attributes, and implementing robust normalization procedures. Successful completion of this sprint will result in an `E57ParserLib` capable of providing a more complete representation of the scanned environment.
