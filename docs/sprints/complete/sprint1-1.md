Backlog: Phase 1 - Sprint 1.1: LAS File Loading and Display (C++/Qt6)
Introduction

This document details the backlog for Sprint 1.1 of Phase 1: "Core Viewer & Basic Management" for the Open-Source Point Cloud Registration Software. Building upon the foundation established in Sprint 1 (E57 file loading), this sprint aims to extend the application's capabilities to include loading and displaying point cloud data from .las files. This will provide users with greater flexibility in importing common point cloud formats.
User Stories

    User Story 1: As a user, I want to load a LAS file into the application so that I can process my scan data from various sources.

        Description: This user story focuses on enabling the application to import and display point cloud data stored in the .las format. The application should correctly parse the LAS header and point records to extract XYZ coordinates, similar to the E57 implementation. This will involve creating a dedicated LAS parser and integrating it into the existing file loading workflow.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Update UI for File Input: Modify the "Open File" dialog to include .las as a selectable file extension.

            Create LAS Parser Class: Develop a new C++ class, LasParser, similar in structure to E57Parser, to handle the binary parsing of .las files.

            Implement LAS Parsing Logic: In LasParser, implement methods to read the LAS header (version, point data format, number of points) and iterate through point records to extract X, Y, Z coordinates. Initially, focus on uncompressed points (Format 0, 1, 2, 3) and ignore extra attributes like intensity, RGB, etc., for simplicity.

            Integrate LAS Parser in Main Window: Modify MainWindow::onOpenFileClicked() to detect if the selected file is a .las file and, if so, instantiate LasParser and call its parse() method.

            Pass Data to Viewer: Ensure the PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud() method can accept and display point data originating from either E57Parser or LasParser. The data format passed (e.g., std::vector<float>) should be consistent.

            Error Handling for LAS: Implement error handling within LasParser for malformed or unsupported LAS files, and display appropriate error messages to the user via QMessageBox.

        References between Files:

            mainwindow.h/mainwindow.cpp will be modified to handle .las file extensions and instantiate LasParser.

            lasparser.h/lasparser.cpp will be new files containing the LAS parsing logic.

            pointcloudviewerwidget.h/pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp should remain largely unchanged in their loadPointCloud method, assuming a consistent input data format from both parsers.

            CMakeLists.txt will need to be updated to include the new lasparser.cpp source file.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The "Open File" dialog allows selecting .las files.

            Upon selecting a valid, small .las file, its point cloud data is displayed correctly in the 3D viewport.

            The application gracefully handles invalid or corrupted .las files, displaying an informative error message without crashing.

            Both .e57 and .las files can be loaded interchangeably.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1: Load a valid small LAS file.

                Test Data: A pre-prepared, small .las file (e.g., 10,000-50,000 points) with known geometry.

                Expected Result: The point cloud from the LAS file is rendered correctly in the 3D viewport.

                Testing Tool: Manual desktop application testing, visual inspection.

            Test Case 2: Load a LAS file with different point data formats (e.g., Format 0 and Format 1).

                Test Data: Two small .las files, one with Format 0 and one with Format 1.

                Expected Result: Both files load and display correctly.

                Testing Tool: Manual desktop application testing.

            Test Case 3: Attempt to load a corrupted or malformed LAS file.

                Test Data: A .las file with an invalid header or truncated point data.

                Expected Result: The application displays an informative error message box (e.g., "Failed to parse LAS file: Invalid header") and does not crash.

                Testing Tool: Manual desktop application testing.

            Test Case 4: Load an E57 file after loading a LAS file, and vice-versa.

                Test Data: A valid .e57 file and a valid .las file.

                Expected Result: Both file types load and display correctly in sequence.

                Testing Tool: Manual desktop application testing.

Actions to Undertake (Consolidated for Sprint 1.1)

    Update CMakeLists.txt (or .pro file): Add lasparser.cpp to the list of source files.

    Modify mainwindow.h:

        Include lasparser.h.

        Potentially update the onOpenFileClicked() slot signature or logic to handle multiple file types gracefully.

    Modify mainwindow.cpp:

        In onOpenFileClicked(), use QFileInfo to determine the file extension (.e57 or .las).

        Based on the extension, instantiate either E57Parser or LasParser.

        Call the appropriate parser's parse() method.

        Handle potential parsing errors from both parsers (e.g., using try-catch blocks or checking return values) and display QMessageBox for errors.

        Pass the resulting std::vector<float> to pointcloudviewerwidget->loadPointCloud().

    Create lasparser.h:

        Define the LasParser class with a public method parse(const QString& filePath) returning std::vector<float>.

        Include necessary Qt headers for file I/O (<QFile>, <QDataStream>, <QByteArray>, <QString>) and standard library headers (<vector>, <iostream>).

    Create lasparser.cpp:

        Implement the LasParser::parse() method.

        Open the .las file using QFile.

        Read the LAS header (signature, version, point data format ID, offset to point data, number of point records).

        Based on the point data format ID, read the XYZ coordinates for each point record.

        Store the XYZ coordinates in a std::vector<float>.

        Include basic error checks for file opening, header validation, and reading.

    Review pointcloudviewerwidget.h and pointcloudviewerwidget.cpp:

        Ensure loadPointCloud(const std::vector<float>& points) method is generic enough to accept point data from both E57 and LAS parsers without modification. (This should ideally be the case if the parser always returns std::vector<float> for XYZ).

        No significant changes are expected here unless the point data format from LAS requires specific handling (e.g., if color/intensity were to be included in the future).

Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated for Sprint 1.1)

    The "Open File" dialog in the application correctly filters for and allows selection of both .e57 and .las file extensions.

    Selecting a valid, small .las file successfully loads and displays its point cloud in the 3D viewport, similar to .e57 files.

    The application maintains smooth camera navigation (orbit, pan, zoom) when a .las file is loaded.

    The application does not crash or exhibit unexpected behavior when loading a .las file.

    Attempting to load an invalid or corrupted .las file results in a user-friendly error message (e.g., via QMessageBox) and prevents application crash.

    The application can successfully load an .e57 file, then a .las file, and vice versa, without issues.

            Testing Tool: C++ unit testing framework.

Assumptions and Dependencies

    LAS File Structure (Simplified): For Sprint 1.1, the LasParser will primarily focus on reading the header and basic XYZ point records (e.g., Point Data Record Format 0, 1, 2, 3). It will not initially handle variable length records (VLRs), georeferencing information, or advanced compression schemes.

    Point Data Format Consistency: It is assumed that the LasParser will extract point coordinates as float values (X, Y, Z) and return them in a std::vector<float>, consistent with the E57Parser's output, so PointCloudViewerWidget does not require modification.

    Qt Libraries: Continued reliance on Qt6 libraries for UI and file I/O.

    OpenGL: Continued reliance on OpenGL for 3D rendering.

Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance: Loading and rendering of small .las files should be responsive and maintain a smooth frame rate. Parsing should be efficient.

    Usability: The file open dialog should be intuitive. Error messages for .las files should be clear and guide the user.

    Maintainability: The LasParser class should be well-encapsulated and follow C++ and Qt coding standards.

    Robustness: The application should not crash when encountering malformed or unsupported .las files; instead, it should provide informative feedback.

    Scalability (Future): The parsing architecture should be extensible to support more complex LAS features (e.g., color, intensity, various point formats, compression) in future sprints.

Conclusion

Sprint 1.1 successfully expands the application's file loading capabilities by integrating support for .las point cloud files. This enhancement significantly increases the utility of the software by allowing users to work with another widely adopted industry standard format. The implementation will build upon the existing architecture, ensuring a consistent user experience for loading different data types.
