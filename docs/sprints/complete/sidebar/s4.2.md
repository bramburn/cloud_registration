Sprint 4.2 Backlog: SQLite Schema for Registration & Basic Matrix Storage
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 4.2 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project, following the completion of Sprint 4.1 (Full Scan Metadata Extraction & Enhanced Project Info). As defined in "Phase 4: Core Data Enhancement & Initial Registration Prep" of the main Product Requirements Document, this sprint's primary objective is to establish the necessary database infrastructure within project_data.sqlite to support future registration functionalities. This involves creating new tables for RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices and implementing logic to store placeholder identity matrices for newly added scans and clusters. This sprint is crucial for preparing the data persistence layer for the core registration features planned in subsequent phases.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Implement SQLite Tables for Registration Status and Transformation Matrices

        Description: As a developer, I need the RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables, as defined in the original PRD (Sprint 3.4 section, now being implemented in Phase 4), to be created with the correct schema in the project_data.sqlite database when a project is created or an older project is opened, so the application has the necessary persistent storage for future registration results and spatial transformations.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Define RegistrationStatus Table Schema:

                In SQLiteManager.cpp (or a dedicated schema management utility), define the SQL DDL for the RegistrationStatus table:

                    item_id (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY): Stores scan_id or cluster_id.

                    item_type (TEXT, NOT NULL): Indicates if item_id refers to a "SCAN" or "CLUSTER".

                    status (TEXT, NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'UNREGISTERED'): Stores the registration status (e.g., "UNREGISTERED", "PROCESSING", "REGISTERED_MANUAL", "REGISTERED_AUTO", "FAILED_REGISTRATION", "NEEDS_REVIEW").

                    error_metric_value (REAL, NULLABLE): Stores the quantitative error metric of the registration.

                    error_metric_type (TEXT, NULLABLE): Describes the type of error metric (e.g., "RMSE", "MeanTargetResidual").

                    last_registration_date (TEXT, NULLABLE): ISO 8601 timestamp of the last registration operation.

            Define TransformationMatrices Table Schema:

                In SQLiteManager.cpp, define the SQL DDL for the TransformationMatrices table:

                    item_id (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY): Stores scan_id or cluster_id.

                    item_type (TEXT, NOT NULL): Indicates "SCAN" or "CLUSTER".

                    matrix_m00 to matrix_m33 (REAL, NOT NULL): 16 individual REAL fields to store the elements of a 4x4 transformation matrix. (Alternatively, a single TEXT or BLOB field for a serialized matrix could be considered, but individual fields are chosen for potential direct querying benefits, though serialization is often more practical for complex objects). For this PRD, we'll specify individual REAL fields.

                    relative_to_item_id (TEXT, NULLABLE): Foreign key to another item_id in TransformationMatrices if this matrix is relative to another scan/cluster. NULL if relative to the project origin.

                    last_transform_date (TEXT, NULLABLE): ISO 8601 timestamp of the last transformation update.

            Implement Schema Creation/Migration Logic:

                Enhance SQLiteManager::initializeSchema() (or a dedicated schema migration function if one exists).

                This logic should check for the existence of RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables.

                If the tables do not exist (e.g., new project or opening a project created before this sprint), execute the DDL statements to create them.

                Ensure this process is idempotent (running it multiple times on a database with the tables already present does not cause errors).

                Consider a simple schema versioning mechanism within the SQLite database (e.g., a schema_info table with a version number) to manage future schema changes more robustly, though for this specific sprint, a simple "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS" might suffice.

        References between Files:

            SQLiteManager.h/.cpp: Will contain the DDL statements and logic in initializeSchema() (or a migration function) to create/update these tables.

            project_data.sqlite: The schema of this database file will be extended with the new RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables.

            ProjectManager.cpp: Calls SQLiteManager::initializeSchema() upon project creation or load, indirectly triggering the new table creations.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When a new project is created, its project_data.sqlite database file includes empty RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables with all specified columns and their correct data types and constraints (PK, NOT NULL, DEFAULT).

            When an existing project created before this sprint (i.e., lacking these tables) is opened, the RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables are successfully added to its project_data.sqlite file without affecting existing data.

            The application does not crash or error out if these tables already exist when initializeSchema() is called.

            The primary keys (item_id) are correctly defined for both tables.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Create a New Project.

                Test Data: N/A.

                Expected Result: Open the newly created project_data.sqlite file using an SQLite browser. Verify that RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables exist. Inspect their schemas to confirm all columns (item_id, item_type, status, matrix_m00-matrix_m33, etc.) are present with the correct data types (TEXT, REAL, NULLABLE properties, DEFAULT values).

                Testing Tool: Manual project creation, SQLite Browser (e.g., DB Browser for SQLite).

            Test Case 1.2: Open an Older Project (Schema Migration).

                Test Data: A project_data.sqlite file from a project created before Sprint 4.2 (i.e., without RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables). This might require temporarily reverting SQLiteManager::initializeSchema() to an older state, creating a project, then updating SQLiteManager and re-opening.

                Expected Result: The application opens the project successfully. The RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables are added to the existing SQLite file. Existing data in other tables (Scans, Clusters) remains intact.

                Testing Tool: Manual project opening, SQLite Browser.

            Test Case 1.3: Idempotency of Schema Creation.

                Test Data: A project that has already been opened or created with the Sprint 4.2 schema changes.

                Expected Result: Close and reopen the project multiple times. The application loads without errors, and the schema for RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices remains correct (no duplicate tables, no errors during initializeSchema()).

                Testing Tool: Manual project opening, Application Logs, SQLite Browser.

    User Story 2: Basic Storage of Identity Transformation Matrix (Placeholder)

        Description: As a developer, when a new scan or cluster is added to the project (either through import or creation), I want a default identity transformation matrix to be automatically created and stored for it in the TransformationMatrices table, so that every spatially relevant item in the project has an initial, well-defined transformation record.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Modify Scan Import Logic:

                In ScanImportManager::createScanInfo (or where ScanInfo is finalized before DB insertion), after a ScanInfo object is created and its scan_id is generated:

                    Call a new method in SQLiteManager (e.g., insertIdentityTransform(itemId, itemType)) to add a record to TransformationMatrices.

                    itemId will be the scan_id.

                    itemType will be "SCAN".

                    The matrix values stored will represent a 4x4 identity matrix (diagonal elements matrix_m00, matrix_m11, matrix_m22, matrix_m33 are 1.0, all other matrix elements are 0.0).

                    relative_to_item_id should be NULL (or an empty string, depending on DB convention for NULL foreign keys) to indicate it's relative to the project origin.

                    last_transform_date should be set to the current timestamp.

            Modify Cluster Creation Logic:

                In ProjectManager::createCluster (or ClusterManager if it exists), after a ClusterInfo object is created and its cluster_id is generated:

                    Call the same SQLiteManager::insertIdentityTransform(itemId, itemType) method.

                    itemId will be the cluster_id.

                    itemType will be "CLUSTER".

                    Store an identity matrix as described above.

                    relative_to_item_id should be NULL.

                    last_transform_date should be set to the current timestamp.

            Implement SQLiteManager::insertIdentityTransform():

                This new method in SQLiteManager.h/.cpp will take itemId (TEXT) and itemType (TEXT) as parameters.

                It will construct and execute an SQL INSERT statement for the TransformationMatrices table, populating item_id, item_type, all 16 matrix elements (1.0 for m00, m11, m22, m33; 0.0 for others), relative_to_item_id (as NULL), and last_transform_date.

                Ensure this operation is part of the same transaction if scan/cluster creation is transactional.

        References between Files:

            ScanImportManager.cpp: Calls SQLiteManager::insertIdentityTransform() after a scan is processed for import.

            ProjectManager.cpp (or ClusterManager.cpp): Calls SQLiteManager::insertIdentityTransform() after a cluster is created.

            SQLiteManager.h/.cpp: New method insertIdentityTransform() implemented, performing DML INSERT into TransformationMatrices.

            project_data.sqlite: TransformationMatrices table will be populated with identity matrices for new scans/clusters.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Upon successfully importing a new scan, a corresponding record is created in the TransformationMatrices table. This record has the scan's ID, type "SCAN", an identity matrix, a NULL relative_to_item_id, and a valid last_transform_date.

            Upon successfully creating a new cluster, a corresponding record is created in the TransformationMatrices table. This record has the cluster's ID, type "CLUSTER", an identity matrix, a NULL relative_to_item_id, and a valid last_transform_date.

            The operation is robust and handles potential database errors during insertion.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Import a New Scan.

                Test Data: A valid .las or .e57 scan file.

                Expected Result: After successful import, query the TransformationMatrices table in project_data.sqlite. Verify a new row exists where item_id matches the imported scan's ID, item_type is "SCAN", matrix elements form an identity matrix (m00=1, m11=1, m22=1, m33=1, others=0), relative_to_item_id is NULL, and last_transform_date is recent.

                Testing Tool: Manual import, SQLite Browser.

            Test Case 2.2: Create a New Cluster.

                Test Data: N/A (create cluster via UI/ProjectManager).

                Expected Result: After successful cluster creation, query the TransformationMatrices table. Verify a new row exists for the cluster with type "CLUSTER" and an identity matrix, similar to Test Case 2.1.

                Testing Tool: Manual cluster creation, SQLite Browser.

            Test Case 2.3: Import Multiple Scans.

                Test Data: Import 3 scan files.

                Expected Result: TransformationMatrices table contains 3 new records, one for each scan, each with an identity matrix.

                Testing Tool: Manual import, SQLite Browser.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 4.2 Overall)

    Database Schema Implementation: Write and integrate DDL for RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables into SQLiteManager.

    Schema Migration Handling: Implement basic logic to add these tables if missing when opening older projects.

    Identity Matrix Storage: Modify scan import and cluster creation workflows to insert default identity matrices into TransformationMatrices.

    Unit & Integration Testing: Develop tests to verify schema creation, migration, and correct insertion of identity matrices.

4. References between Files (Sprint 4.2 Overall)

    SQLiteManager.h/.cpp: Central for schema DDL, new DML for TransformationMatrices, and schema migration logic.

    ScanImportManager.cpp: Will be modified to trigger identity matrix insertion for new scans.

    ProjectManager.cpp (or ClusterManager.cpp): Will be modified to trigger identity matrix insertion for new clusters.

    project_data.sqlite: The database file whose schema is directly modified and populated.

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    File 1: SQLiteManager.h/.cpp (Significantly Modified)

        Purpose: To manage all SQLite database interactions, including schema definition and data manipulation.

        Contents (Modifications):

            DDL strings for creating RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables.

            Enhancements to initializeSchema() or a new schema migration function to create these tables if they don't exist.

            New public method insertIdentityTransform(const QString& itemId, const QString& itemType) to add default matrix records.

            Internal SQL queries for inserting into TransformationMatrices.

        Relationships: Directly interacts with project_data.sqlite. Called by ProjectManager, ScanImportManager, etc.

    File 2: ScanImportManager.cpp (Modified)

        Purpose: Manages the scan import process.

        Contents (Modifications): After successfully processing a scan file and generating its scan_id, it will call SQLiteManager::insertIdentityTransform() for the new scan.

        Relationships: Calls SQLiteManager.

    File 3: ProjectManager.cpp (or ClusterManager.cpp if it exists) (Modified)

        Purpose: Manages project-level entities like clusters.

        Contents (Modifications): After successfully creating a new cluster and generating its cluster_id, it will call SQLiteManager::insertIdentityTransform() for the new cluster.

        Relationships: Calls SQLiteManager.

    File 4: project_data.sqlite (Schema Change)

        Purpose: The project's main database file.

        Contents (Additions): New tables RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices will be added to its schema. The TransformationMatrices table will be populated with initial identity matrices.

        Relationships: Managed by SQLiteManager.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 4.2 Overall)

    The project_data.sqlite database schema is successfully extended to include RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables with all specified columns and constraints.

    This schema extension occurs correctly for both newly created projects and when opening projects created prior to this sprint (basic migration by adding tables if missing).

    For every new scan imported into a project, a default identity transformation matrix is recorded in the TransformationMatrices table.

    For every new cluster created in a project, a default identity transformation matrix is recorded in the TransformationMatrices table.

    Database operations related to these new tables are robust and handle potential errors.

7. Testing Plan (Sprint 4.2 Overall)

    Unit Tests:

        SQLiteManager:

            Test initializeSchema(): Verify it creates RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices if they don't exist. Verify it doesn't fail if they do exist.

            Test insertIdentityTransform(): Verify it correctly inserts an identity matrix for a given itemId and itemType ("SCAN", "CLUSTER") into TransformationMatrices. Test with valid and invalid itemIds (though FK constraints are not strictly enforced by these tables on itemId directly, good practice to test).

    Integration Tests:

        New Project Workflow: Create a new project -> Verify RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables are present and empty in the SQLite file.

        Scan Import Workflow: Create a new project -> Import a scan -> Verify a record for this scan with an identity matrix exists in TransformationMatrices.

        Cluster Creation Workflow: Create a new project -> Create a cluster -> Verify a record for this cluster with an identity matrix exists in TransformationMatrices.

        Schema Migration Workflow: Take a project_data.sqlite file from before Sprint 4.2 -> Open the project with the updated application -> Verify the new tables are added without data loss in existing tables.

    Manual UI Tests:

        (Indirectly) Create a new project, import scans, create clusters. Use an SQLite browser to inspect project_data.sqlite to confirm the new tables are created and TransformationMatrices is populated with identity matrices for each new scan and cluster.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint 4.1 (Full Scan Metadata Extraction & Enhanced Project Info) is complete and stable.

        The definition of an "identity matrix" (4x4) is standard and agreed upon.

        For this sprint, item_id in the new tables is a simple TEXT field that will store UUIDs from Scans.scan_id or Clusters.cluster_id. Formal foreign key constraints from these tables to Scans or Clusters might be deferred if too complex for this stage but should be noted as a future improvement for data integrity. (The PRD implies item_id is a PK, which is fine, but it conceptually acts as an FK to the actual items).

    Dependencies:

        SQLiteManager module for all database operations.

        ScanImportManager for handling scan imports.

        ProjectManager (or ClusterManager) for cluster creation.

        Qt SQL module and SQLite library.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        Schema creation/migration (adding new tables) should be very fast and not noticeably delay project opening.

        Inserting an identity matrix for each new scan/cluster should add negligible overhead to the import/creation process.

    Data Integrity:

        The schema for the new tables must be correct as per specifications.

        Identity matrices must be stored correctly.

        Schema migration should not corrupt existing project data.

    Robustness: The application should handle scenarios where it tries to add these tables to a database that, for some reason, is read-only or encounters other DB errors, logging issues appropriately.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 4.2 lays essential groundwork for the application's core registration capabilities by establishing the database schema for storing transformation matrices and registration statuses. While no direct user-facing features are added for manipulating this registration data yet, the backend preparation is critical. The automatic creation of placeholder identity matrices ensures that all spatial items in a project have a baseline transformation record from their inception. This sprint ensures the persistence layer is ready for the complex data that registration processes will generate and manage.
