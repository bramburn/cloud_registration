Sprint 2.1 Backlog: Scan/Cluster Loading, Unloading & View Action
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 2.1 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. Building on the scan import and cluster organization features from previous sprints, this sprint focuses on enabling users to manage the memory footprint of their projects by loading and unloading scans and entire clusters. It also introduces the initial "View Point Cloud" action and the necessary visual feedback in the sidebar to indicate the loaded/unloaded state of items. This sprint is critical for allowing users to work with potentially large datasets by selectively bringing point cloud data into memory.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Load Individual Scan

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to select an individual scan in the sidebar and load its point cloud data into memory, so I can prepare it for viewing or processing.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a "Load Scan" option in the context menu for scan items in the SidebarView.

            When "Load Scan" is selected, the ProjectManager (or a PointCloudLoadManager) will be responsible for reading the scan file (path obtained from SQLite Scans table).

            For this sprint, "loading" might mean reading the file header or a small subset of points to simulate memory allocation and confirm file accessibility. Actual rendering is deferred to Phase 3.

            Maintain an in-memory representation or flag indicating that the scan is "loaded."

            Update the scan item's visual state in the SidebarView to indicate it's loaded.

            Handle potential errors during file reading (e.g., file not found if it was a linked import and the original moved, corrupted file) and provide user feedback.

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu) -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager.

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> SQLiteManager (to get scan file_path_relative).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> File System (to read scan file).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> ProjectTreeModel (to update scan's loaded state).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can right-click an unloaded scan in the sidebar and select "Load Scan."

            The application attempts to read data from the scan file.

            The scan's state in the application's memory is updated to "loaded."

            The sidebar UI for that scan item visually changes to indicate it is loaded (e.g., icon change, text style).

            If the scan file is inaccessible or corrupt, an appropriate error message is shown to the user, and the scan remains in an "unloaded" state.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Load a single valid scan. Verify UI state change and internal loaded flag.

            Test Case 1.2: Attempt to load a scan whose linked source file has been moved/deleted. Verify error message and UI state remains unloaded.

            Test Case 1.3: Attempt to load a corrupted scan file. Verify error message.

    User Story 2: Unload Individual Scan

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to select a loaded scan in the sidebar and unload its point cloud data from memory, so I can free up system resources.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement an "Unload Scan" option in the context menu for loaded scan items in the SidebarView.

            When "Unload Scan" is selected, the ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager will release any memory associated with that scan's point cloud data.

            Update the scan's in-memory state to "unloaded."

            Update the scan item's visual state in the SidebarView to indicate it's unloaded.

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu) -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager.

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> (Manages in-memory point cloud data).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> ProjectTreeModel (to update scan's loaded state).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can right-click a loaded scan in the sidebar and select "Unload Scan."

            Any in-memory data for that scan is released.

            The scan's state in the application's memory is updated to "unloaded."

            The sidebar UI for that scan item visually changes to indicate it is unloaded.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Load a scan, then unload it. Verify UI state change and (conceptually) memory release.

            Test Case 2.2: Ensure unloading a scan that is already unloaded has no adverse effect and UI remains "unloaded."

    User Story 3: Load All Scans in a Cluster

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to select a cluster (or sub-cluster) in the sidebar and load all scans contained within it (and its sub-clusters recursively) into memory, so I can work with a group of related scans.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a "Load All Scans in Cluster" option in the context menu for cluster items in the SidebarView.

            When selected, the ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager will identify all scans within the selected cluster and its sub-clusters (recursively, by querying SQLite Scans and Clusters tables).

            For each identified scan that is not already loaded, initiate the loading process (as per User Story 1).

            Update the visual state of all affected scans and the parent cluster(s) in the sidebar. A cluster could be marked "loaded" if all its direct and indirect child scans are loaded, or "partially loaded" if some are.

            Provide progress indication if loading multiple scans.

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu) -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager.

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> SQLiteManager (to get scan hierarchy and paths).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> File System (to read multiple scan files).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> ProjectTreeModel (to update states).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can right-click a cluster and select "Load All Scans in Cluster."

            All scans within that cluster and its sub-clusters are loaded (their UI state changes to "loaded").

            The cluster's UI state in the sidebar updates to reflect that its contents are loaded (e.g., "fully loaded" or "partially loaded" if some fail).

            Scans already loaded are not reloaded but remain loaded.

            Progress is shown if the operation is lengthy.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Load scans in a cluster with 3 scans. Verify all scans and cluster UI state.

            Test Case 3.2: Load scans in a cluster with nested sub-clusters. Verify all scans load.

            Test Case 3.3: Load a cluster where some scans are already loaded. Verify no re-loading and all become loaded.

            Test Case 3.4: Load a cluster containing one problematic (e.g., missing) scan. Verify other scans load, error is reported for the problematic one, and cluster shows "partially loaded" or similar.

    User Story 4: Unload All Scans in a Cluster

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to select a cluster in the sidebar and unload all scans contained within it (and its sub-clusters recursively) from memory, so I can quickly free up resources used by that group.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement an "Unload All Scans in Cluster" option in the context menu for cluster items.

            When selected, the ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager will identify all scans within the selected cluster and its sub-clusters.

            For each identified scan that is currently loaded, initiate the unloading process (as per User Story 2).

            Update the visual state of all affected scans and the parent cluster(s) in the sidebar to "unloaded."

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu) -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager.

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> SQLiteManager (to identify scans in cluster).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> ProjectTreeModel (to update states).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can right-click a cluster and select "Unload All Scans in Cluster."

            All loaded scans within that cluster and its sub-clusters are unloaded (their UI state changes to "unloaded").

            The cluster's UI state in the sidebar updates to "unloaded."

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 4.1: Load all scans in a cluster, then unload them. Verify UI states.

            Test Case 4.2: Partially load a cluster (some scans loaded, some not), then unload all. Verify all become unloaded.

    User Story 5: Visual Indicators for Loaded/Unloaded State

        Description: As a user, I want to clearly see in the sidebar whether an individual scan or the scans within a cluster are currently loaded into memory or not, so I can understand the current memory usage and data availability.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Design distinct visual cues (e.g., icons, text color, font style, overlay icons) for:

                Individual scan: Loaded state.

                Individual scan: Unloaded state.

                Cluster: All child scans loaded.

                Cluster: Some child scans loaded (partially loaded).

                Cluster: No child scans loaded (fully unloaded).

            Implement these visual cues in the ProjectTreeModel's data roles and/or a custom item delegate for the SidebarView.

            Ensure the sidebar updates these visual cues dynamically when scan/cluster load states change.

        References between Files:

            ProjectTreeModel (data roles) / SidebarItemDelegate (custom painting) -> SidebarView.

            State information will come from ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager's internal tracking.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Individual scans in the sidebar clearly show a "loaded" or "unloaded" visual state.

            Cluster items in the sidebar clearly show if their contents are "fully loaded," "partially loaded," or "fully unloaded."

            These visual states update immediately after any load/unload operation.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 5.1: Verify distinct visual states for loaded scan, unloaded scan.

            Test Case 5.2: Load all scans in a cluster, verify cluster shows "fully loaded."

            Test Case 5.3: Load some scans in a cluster, verify cluster shows "partially loaded."

            Test Case 5.4: Unload all scans in a cluster, verify cluster shows "fully unloaded."

            Test Case 5.5: Check visual state updates for nested clusters.

    User Story 6: "View Point Cloud" Action (Initial Placeholder)

        Description: As a user, I want to right-click on a scan or a cluster in the sidebar and select "View Point Cloud," which should trigger the loading of the necessary scan(s) (if not already loaded), so I can eventually see their point cloud data in the main view.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Add a "View Point Cloud" option to the context menu for scan and cluster items in the SidebarView.

            When selected for a scan:

                If the scan is not loaded, trigger the "Load Scan" action for it.

                (For this sprint) Log to console or display a message like "Scan [scan_name] is now loaded and ready for viewing." Actual rendering is in Phase 3.

            When selected for a cluster:

                If not all scans in the cluster (and sub-clusters) are loaded, trigger the "Load All Scans in Cluster" action.

                (For this sprint) Log to console or display a message like "Scans in cluster [cluster_name] are now loaded and ready for viewing."

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu) -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager.

            This action will reuse the load logic from User Stories 1 and 3.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            "View Point Cloud" option is available in scan and cluster context menus.

            Selecting "View Point Cloud" for an unloaded scan triggers its loading process and its UI state updates to "loaded." A confirmation message/log is produced.

            Selecting "View Point Cloud" for a cluster with unloaded scans triggers the loading process for all its scans, and their UI states update. A confirmation message/log is produced.

            If scans are already loaded, the action still produces the confirmation message/log without re-triggering load.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 6.1: "View Point Cloud" on an unloaded scan. Verify it loads and message appears.

            Test Case 6.2: "View Point Cloud" on a loaded scan. Verify message appears (no re-load).

            Test Case 6.3: "View Point Cloud" on a cluster with all scans unloaded. Verify all load and message appears.

            Test Case 6.4: "View Point Cloud" on a cluster with some scans loaded. Verify remaining scans load and message appears.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 2.1 Overall)

    UI/UX Design: Design icons/visual styles for loaded/unloaded/partially loaded states for scans and clusters. Refine context menu structure.

    Module Enhancement/Creation:

        Create/Enhance PointCloudLoadManager (or integrate into ProjectManager) to handle:

            Reading scan file data (placeholder/header for now).

            Managing in-memory representation/flags for loaded scans.

            Releasing scan data from memory.

            Tracking loaded state of individual scans.

        Enhance ProjectTreeModel to:

            Store and provide data for the loaded/unloaded visual state of items.

            Reflect changes in loaded state dynamically.

        Enhance SidebarView context menus with Load/Unload/View actions.

    Implementation: Develop the features outlined in the user stories.

    Error Handling: Implement robust error handling for file access issues during scan loading.

    Unit Testing: For PointCloudLoadManager (loading/unloading logic, state tracking).

    Integration Testing: Test interactions between sidebar actions, load manager, and model updates.

4. References between Files

    SidebarView (context menus) -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager

    ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> SQLiteManager (for scan paths, cluster contents)

    ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> File System (for reading scan files)

    ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> In-memory data structures for loaded point clouds (conceptual for now)

    ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> ProjectTreeModel (for updating visual states)

    ProjectTreeModel / SidebarItemDelegate (custom delegate if needed for complex visuals) -> SidebarView

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    Code Files (Illustrative, additions/modifications):

        PointCloudLoadManager.h/.cpp (New, or logic within ProjectManager): Manages the loading and unloading of point cloud data from files, tracks loaded states.

        ProjectManager.h/.cpp (Modified): To coordinate with PointCloudLoadManager, query SQLite for scan paths and cluster contents for load/unload operations.

        ProjectTreeModel.h/.cpp (Significantly Modified): To include and manage "loaded_state" for scan and cluster items. To provide data for visual indicators of loaded/unloaded status.

        SidebarWidget.h/.cpp (Modified): Context menus expanded for Load/Unload/View actions.

        SidebarItemDelegate.h/.cpp (Potentially New/Modified): If custom drawing is needed for loaded/unloaded state icons/styles beyond what standard model roles provide.

        MainWindow.h/.cpp (Modified): Potentially to handle global status updates or progress bars for batch load/unload operations.

    No new persistent file types are expected in this sprint (like new .json or .sqlite tables), but existing project_data.sqlite will be heavily read from.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 2.1 Overall)

    Users can load and unload individual scans via the sidebar context menu.

    Users can load and unload all scans within a selected cluster (and its sub-clusters) via the sidebar context menu.

    The sidebar provides clear, distinct, and dynamically updated visual indicators for the loaded/unloaded/partially loaded state of both individual scans and clusters.

    A "View Point Cloud" action is available for scans and clusters, which ensures the necessary data is loaded (placeholder for actual viewing in this sprint).

    Basic error handling for file access during loading is implemented.

    The application remains responsive during load/unload operations (especially for single, small scans; progress indication for larger batches).

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        PointCloudLoadManager:

            Test loading a scan (mock file read, state update).

            Test unloading a scan (mock memory release, state update).

            Test error handling for attempting to load a non-existent/corrupt file.

            Test state tracking for multiple scans.

        ProjectTreeModel:

            Test setting/getting loaded state for scan items.

            Test calculating and setting loaded state for cluster items based on children.

    Integration Tests:

        Select "Load Scan" from sidebar -> Verify PointCloudLoadManager is called with correct scan -> Verify ProjectTreeModel is updated -> Verify SidebarView reflects change.

        Select "Load All Scans in Cluster" -> Verify PointCloudLoadManager is called for all relevant scans -> Verify ProjectTreeModel updates for all scans and cluster -> Verify SidebarView reflects changes.

        Similar tests for "Unload" operations.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S2.1.1: Load/Unload single scan.

            Test Data: Project with several unloaded scans.

            Expected Result: Context menu shows "Load Scan". Selecting it changes scan's visual state to "loaded". Context menu now shows "Unload Scan". Selecting it changes state back to "unloaded".

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S2.1.2: Load/Unload cluster.

            Test Data: Project with a cluster containing multiple scans and sub-clusters with scans.

            Expected Result: "Load All..." changes all child scans and cluster(s) to "loaded" state. "Unload All..." changes them back.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S2.1.3: Visual state consistency for clusters.

            Test Data: Cluster with 3 scans. Load 1 scan.

            Expected Result: Cluster shows "partially loaded". Load remaining 2. Cluster shows "fully loaded". Unload 1. Cluster shows "partially loaded". Unload all. Cluster shows "fully unloaded".

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S2.1.4: "View Point Cloud" action.

            Test Data: Unloaded scan, loaded scan, cluster with mixed loaded/unloaded scans.

            Expected Result: Action triggers loading if necessary. Console log/message confirms readiness for viewing. UI states update correctly.

            Testing Tool: Manual, Console/Log viewer.

        Test Case S2.1.5: Error handling on load.

            Test Data: Project with a linked scan whose source file is then deleted/renamed.

            Expected Result: Attempting to "Load Scan" or "View Point Cloud" for this scan shows an error message. Scan remains "unloaded".

            Testing Tool: Manual.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprints 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 functionalities (project management, scan import, cluster organization, SQLite storage of hierarchy and basic scan metadata) are completed and stable.

        A mechanism exists to get the file path for a scan from its ID/model item (via SQLite).

        For this sprint, "loading point cloud data" does not require full parsing and rendering, but can be simulated by reading headers or a small data chunk to verify file access and represent a change in memory state.

    Dependencies:

        GUI Framework (e.g., Qt 6) for context menus, sidebar view, and visual state updates.

        SQLite library for retrieving scan file paths and cluster contents.

        File system access libraries/APIs.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        Context menus should appear instantly.

        Updating visual state in the sidebar after load/unload of a single item should be immediate.

        For batch load/unload of clusters, if the operation takes more than 1-2 seconds, asynchronous operation with progress feedback should be considered (though full async might be out of scope for just state flagging). For this sprint, synchronous updates are acceptable if quick for a moderate number of items.

    Usability:

        Visual indicators for loaded/unloaded states must be easily distinguishable and intuitive.

        Context menu options should be clearly named.

    Responsiveness:

        The UI should remain responsive while load/unload operations are conceptually happening. For this sprint, as full data isn't loaded into a complex renderer, this should be manageable.

    Feedback:

        Clear feedback to the user if a load operation fails (e.g., file not found).

10. Conclusion

Sprint 2.1 introduces fundamental interactions for managing data in memory, a crucial aspect of any point cloud application. By enabling users to load and unload scans and clusters, and providing clear visual feedback, this sprint empowers users to control resource consumption. The "View Point Cloud" action, even as a placeholder, sets the stage for the actual visualization work in later phases. Successful completion will make the application feel more dynamic and interactive in its data handling.
