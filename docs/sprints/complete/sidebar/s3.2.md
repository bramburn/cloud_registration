Sprint 3.2 Backlog: Basic Point Cloud Viewer Integration
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 3.2 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. Following the work in Sprint 3.1 on robust data persistence and error handling, this sprint shifts focus to the initial visualization of point cloud data. The primary goal is to integrate a basic 3D point cloud rendering component into the main application window, enable the "View Point Cloud" action to display data in this viewer, and implement fundamental camera controls. This sprint will provide users with their first visual interaction with the scan data within the application.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Integrate Basic 3D Point Cloud Viewer Component

        Description: As a user, I want a dedicated 3D viewing area integrated into the main application window, so that I have a designated space where point cloud data will be rendered for inspection.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Research and select a suitable technology/library for basic 3D point cloud rendering within the application's framework (e.g., a native OpenGL widget if using Qt, or a simple 3D graphics library).

            Design the layout of the main application window to incorporate this 3D viewer panel (e.g., alongside the sidebar).

            Implement the basic UI shell for the PointCloudViewerWidget (or equivalent component), ensuring it's correctly embedded in the main window.

            Initialize the viewer with a default empty state or a simple 3D grid/axes when no point cloud is loaded.

        References between Files:

            MainWindow (or main application UI class) will instantiate and display the PointCloudViewerWidget.

            PointCloudViewerWidget will be a new UI component.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A distinct 3D viewing panel/widget is present in the main application window when a project is open.

            The viewer initializes to a default state (e.g., empty with a background color, or showing a 3D grid/axes) when no data is loaded.

            The viewer component does not cause application instability or significant performance degradation on startup.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Launch application, open a project. Verify the 3D viewer panel is visible and displays its default state.

            Test Case 1.2: Resize the main application window. Verify the viewer panel resizes appropriately within the layout.

    User Story 2: Render Point Cloud Data in Viewer

        Description: As a user, when I invoke the "View Point Cloud" action for a loaded scan (or all loaded scans in a cluster), I want the actual point cloud data to be fetched from the scan file(s) and rendered as a 3D point cloud in the viewer, so I can visually inspect the scan data.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Enhance the PointCloudLoadManager (or ProjectManager) to fully read point cloud data (X, Y, Z coordinates, and optionally basic color/intensity if simple to parse) from .las and .e57 files when a scan is "loaded" for viewing. (This goes beyond the header/placeholder loading of Sprint 2.1).

            Implement a mechanism for the PointCloudLoadManager to pass the loaded point data (e.g., an array of 3D points/vertices) to the PointCloudViewerWidget.

            Implement rendering logic within PointCloudViewerWidget to display the received array of points as a 3D point cloud (e.g., using GL_POINTS).

            The "View Point Cloud" action (from Sprint 2.1 context menus) should now trigger this full data loading and rendering pipeline for the selected scan(s) or scans within a selected cluster.

            Handle displaying point clouds from a single scan or an aggregation of multiple loaded scans (e.g., all scans in a cluster).

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu "View Point Cloud") -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager.

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> SQLiteManager (to get scan file paths).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> File System (to read full point data from scan files).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> PointCloudViewerWidget (to pass point data).

            PointCloudViewerWidget (renders the data).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Selecting "View Point Cloud" for a single scan loads its data and renders it as points in the 3D viewer.

            Selecting "View Point Cloud" for a cluster loads data for all scans in that cluster (and its sub-clusters) and renders them together in the 3D viewer.

            Points are displayed in 3D space according to their coordinates.

            Basic differentiation of points (e.g., default color) is visible.

            The viewer updates to show the new data when the action is invoked.

            If a scan file cannot be read or is corrupted, a user-friendly error is shown, and previously displayed data (if any) might remain or the viewer clears.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Load and view a single .las file. Verify points are rendered.

            Test Case 2.2: Load and view a single .e57 file. Verify points are rendered.

            Test Case 2.3: Load and view all scans in a cluster (e.g., 2-3 scans). Verify all point clouds are aggregated and rendered in the same scene.

            Test Case 2.4: View a scan, then view a different scan. Verify the viewer updates correctly to show the new scan.

            Test Case 2.5: Attempt to view a scan that is linked but the source file is missing/corrupt. Verify error handling and viewer state.

    User Story 3: Implement Basic Camera Controls for Viewer

        Description: As a user, I want basic 3D camera controls (such as orbit, pan, and zoom) for the point cloud viewer, so I can navigate and inspect the displayed point cloud data from different perspectives and distances.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement mouse-based orbit controls (e.g., left-click + drag to rotate the camera around a focal point or the center of the displayed cloud).

            Implement mouse-based pan controls (e.g., right-click + drag or middle-click + drag to translate the camera view).

            Implement mouse-wheel zoom controls (e.g., scroll wheel to move the camera closer to or further from the focal point/data).

            Define a default camera position and orientation when a point cloud is first loaded (e.g., framing the entire cloud).

        References between Files:

            PointCloudViewerWidget will handle mouse events and update its internal camera model/view matrix.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can orbit the camera around the displayed point cloud using mouse actions.

            User can pan the camera view (translate left/right/up/down) using mouse actions.

            User can zoom in and out of the point cloud using the mouse wheel.

            Camera controls are reasonably intuitive and responsive.

            A sensible default view is set when a point cloud is loaded, showing the extent of the data.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Load a point cloud. Verify default camera view frames the data.

            Test Case 3.2: Test orbit functionality. Verify smooth rotation around the data.

            Test Case 3.3: Test pan functionality. Verify view translates correctly.

            Test Case 3.4: Test zoom functionality. Verify smooth zooming in and out.

            Test Case 3.5: Combine orbit, pan, and zoom to navigate to specific areas of a point cloud.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 3.2 Overall)

    Viewer Technology Decision: Finalize the choice of rendering technology/library for the PointCloudViewerWidget.

    Point Cloud Parsing: Implement basic parsing for .las and .e57 files to extract X,Y,Z coordinates (and optionally simple attributes like intensity or RGB if readily available and performant for this initial stage).

    Rendering Pipeline: Develop the OpenGL (or chosen library's) rendering pipeline within PointCloudViewerWidget to draw points.

    Camera Logic: Implement a 3D camera model and the logic for orbit, pan, and zoom manipulations based on mouse input.

    Data Flow: Establish the data flow from file reading (PointCloudLoadManager) to data preparation and then to the PointCloudViewerWidget for rendering.

    UI Integration: Ensure the PointCloudViewerWidget is correctly integrated into the MainWindow layout and responds to "View Point Cloud" actions.

4. References between Files

    MainWindow -> PointCloudViewerWidget (hosts and displays)

    SidebarView (triggers "View Point Cloud") -> ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager

    ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> SQLiteManager (to get scan file paths)

    ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> File System (to read full point data from .las/.e57 files)

    PointCloudLoadManager -> PointCloudViewerWidget (passes point data arrays)

    PointCloudViewerWidget -> (Internal camera model, rendering engine - e.g., OpenGL)

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    Code Files (Illustrative, additions/modifications):

        PointCloudViewerWidget.h/.cpp (New): The core UI component for 3D rendering. Will contain OpenGL/graphics library initialization, rendering loop, point data handling, and camera control logic.

        PointCloudLoadManager.h/.cpp (or ProjectManager) (Significantly Modified): Logic to read full point data (X,Y,Z, basic attributes) from scan files, not just headers. Mechanism to transfer this data to the viewer.

        MainWindow.h/.cpp (Modified): To integrate and manage the PointCloudViewerWidget within its layout.

        ScanFileParserLAS.h/.cpp (Potentially New): Utility class specifically for parsing point data from .las files.

        ScanFileParserE57.h/.cpp (Potentially New): Utility class specifically for parsing point data from .e57 files.

        Shaders (if using direct OpenGL):

            pointcloud_vertex.glsl (New): Basic vertex shader for transforming points.

            pointcloud_fragment.glsl (New): Basic fragment shader for coloring points.

    No new persistent project file types (.json, .sqlite) are introduced or primarily modified in this sprint, but project_data.sqlite will be read to get scan file paths.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 3.2 Overall)

    A 3D viewer panel is integrated into the main application window.

    The "View Point Cloud" action successfully loads point data from selected scans (or scans in clusters) and renders them as a 3D point cloud in the viewer.

    Basic camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom) are functional and allow users to navigate the 3D scene.

    The viewer can display point clouds from single scans as well as aggregated point clouds from multiple scans within a cluster.

    The application remains stable when loading and viewing basic point clouds.

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        PointCloudLoadManager: Test full parsing of sample .las and .e57 files (verify correct number of points, sample coordinate values).

        PointCloudViewerWidget: Test camera control logic (mock input, verify camera matrix changes). Test data loading mechanism (verify it correctly receives and stores point arrays).

        (If applicable) ScanFileParserLAS/E57: Test parsing against known valid and simple scan files.

    Integration Tests:

        Test flow: Sidebar "View Point Cloud" action -> PointCloudLoadManager reads file -> Data passed to PointCloudViewerWidget -> Points rendered.

        Test interaction between camera controls in PointCloudViewerWidget and the rendered scene.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S3.2.1: View Single LAS Scan.

            Test Data: A small, valid .las file (e.g., 1-5 million points).

            Expected Result: Point cloud is rendered in the viewer. Camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom) are functional.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.2.2: View Single E57 Scan.

            Test Data: A small, valid .e57 file.

            Expected Result: Point cloud is rendered. Camera controls functional.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.2.3: View Multiple Scans from a Cluster.

            Test Data: A cluster containing 2-3 small scans.

            Expected Result: All scans in the cluster are loaded and rendered together in the viewer, correctly positioned relative to each other (assuming they are not yet registered, they will appear at their individual origins or last saved transformations).

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.2.4: Camera Control Usability.

            Test Data: Any loaded point cloud.

            Expected Result: Orbit, pan, and zoom are intuitive and allow effective navigation of the scene. Default view upon load is sensible.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.2.5: Clearing Viewer.

            Test Data: Load a scan. Then open a different project or unload the scan.

            Expected Result: Viewer clears or updates to show the new context (or default empty state). No remnants of old data.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.2.6: Handling Large (but manageable for basic rendering) Scan.

            Test Data: A .las or .e57 file of moderate size (e.g., 10-20 million points, depending on initial performance targets for basic rendering).

            Expected Result: Scan loads and renders within an acceptable time frame for this basic viewer. Camera controls remain responsive.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint 3.1 (Robust Data Persistence & Error Handling) is completed and stable.

        Basic parsing of .las and .e57 for X,Y,Z coordinates is feasible within the sprint. Advanced attribute parsing (full RGB, intensity, classifications) might be deferred.

        A suitable 3D graphics API/library (e.g., OpenGL) is available and configured in the development environment.

        For this sprint, performance with very large point clouds is not the primary concern; the focus is on functional basic rendering. LOD and advanced optimization are future sprints.

    Dependencies:

        GUI Framework (e.g., Qt 6) for main window, sidebar, and potentially the viewer widget itself (e.g., QOpenGLWidget).

        Libraries for parsing .las (e.g., LASlib or custom minimal parser) and .e57 (e.g., libE57Format or a simpler alternative if only basic data is needed). If no external libraries, then custom parsing logic will be a dependency.

        SQLite library (for retrieving scan file paths).

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance (Basic Viewer):

        Loading and rendering a small scan (e.g., < 5 million points) should be reasonably quick (e.g., within 2-5 seconds).

        Basic camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom) should be interactive and smooth for these small datasets (e.g., >20-30 FPS).

    Usability:

        Camera controls should follow common 3D navigation paradigms.

        It should be clear to the user which scan(s) are currently being displayed in the viewer.

    Visual Quality (Basic):

        Points should be clearly visible. Default point size and color should be sensible.

    Stability:

        The viewer should not crash when loading valid scan files of supported types.

        Basic error handling should prevent crashes if a file is unreadable (though full error recovery is for S3.1).

10. Conclusion

Sprint 3.2 marks a significant milestone by enabling users to visually interact with their point cloud data for the first time within the application. The integration of a basic 3D viewer, coupled with the ability to load and render scans selected from the sidebar, and navigate them with fundamental camera controls, will transform the application from a purely data management tool into an initial visualization platform. This lays the critical groundwork for all future visual analysis, registration, and processing features.
