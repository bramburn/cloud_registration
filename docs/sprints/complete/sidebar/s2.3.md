Sprint 2.3 Backlog: Cluster Locking & Context Menu Expansion
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 2.3 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. Building on the functionalities developed in Sprints 2.1 and 2.2 (scan/cluster loading, advanced import, SQLite refinement), this sprint focuses on adding cluster state management (Lock/Unlock), providing clear visual indicators for these states in the sidebar, and significantly expanding the sidebar context menus to offer comprehensive actions for managing both scans and clusters, including deletion. This sprint aims to make project item management more robust and user-friendly.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Implement Lock/Unlock Cluster Functionality

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to "Lock" and "Unlock" clusters in the sidebar, so I can protect a group of scans and their relative transformations from accidental changes during broader registration processes, or allow them to be modified.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Add an is_locked column (BOOLEAN, default FALSE) to the SQLite Clusters table.

            Implement "Lock Cluster" option in the context menu for cluster items in the SidebarView.

                When selected, update the is_locked field to TRUE for the corresponding cluster record in the SQLite Clusters table.

            Implement "Unlock Cluster" option in the context menu for cluster items in the SidebarView.

                When selected, update the is_locked field to FALSE for the corresponding cluster record.

            The ProjectManager / ClusterManager will handle these state changes in SQLite.

            The ProjectTreeModel should be notified or re-query to reflect this state change for visual updates.

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu) -> ProjectManager / ClusterManager.

            ProjectManager / ClusterManager -> SQLiteManager (to update is_locked in Clusters table).

            SQLiteManager -> project_data.sqlite (Clusters table).

            ProjectTreeModel (to reflect state for UI) <- SQLiteManager or notification from ClusterManager.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            "Lock Cluster" option is available in the context menu for an unlocked cluster.

            Selecting "Lock Cluster" updates the is_locked field in the SQLite Clusters table to TRUE for that cluster.

            "Unlock Cluster" option is available in the context menu for a locked cluster.

            Selecting "Unlock Cluster" updates the is_locked field in the SQLite Clusters table to FALSE for that cluster.

            The context menu options ("Lock Cluster" / "Unlock Cluster") should toggle based on the current state of the cluster.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Lock an unlocked cluster. Verify context menu changes to "Unlock Cluster". Verify is_locked is TRUE in SQLite.

            Test Case 1.2: Unlock a locked cluster. Verify context menu changes to "Lock Cluster". Verify is_locked is FALSE in SQLite.

            Test Case 1.3: Lock and unlock multiple different clusters. Verify states are managed independently.

    User Story 2: Visual Indicators for Locked/Unlocked Cluster State

        Description: As a user, I want to clearly see in the sidebar whether a cluster is currently locked or unlocked, so I can quickly understand its status and editability in registration workflows.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Design a clear visual indicator for a locked cluster (e.g., a lock icon overlay on the cluster folder icon, or a different folder icon).

            Modify the ProjectTreeModel to fetch the is_locked status for cluster items from SQLite.

            Implement the display of this visual indicator in the SidebarView, likely through a custom item delegate or by utilizing different icons based on the is_locked state provided by the model.

            Ensure the visual indicator updates immediately when a cluster's lock state changes.

        References between Files:

            ProjectTreeModel (data roles for is_locked state) / SidebarItemDelegate (custom painting for lock icon) -> SidebarView.

            ProjectTreeModel <- SQLiteManager (to fetch is_locked status).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Locked clusters in the sidebar are visually distinct from unlocked clusters (e.g., display a lock icon).

            Unlocked clusters do not display the lock icon (or have a distinct "unlocked" visual).

            The visual indicator updates immediately in the sidebar when a cluster is locked or unlocked via the context menu.

            The correct lock/unlock visual state is displayed when a project is loaded.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Lock a cluster. Verify the lock icon (or visual change) appears next to it in the sidebar.

            Test Case 2.2: Unlock the cluster. Verify the lock icon disappears (or visual state reverts).

            Test Case 2.3: Create a project, lock some clusters, save, close, and reopen. Verify the locked clusters still show the lock icon.

    User Story 3: Expand Context Menus for Comprehensive Scan and Cluster Actions

        Description: As a user, I want comprehensive context menus for scans and clusters in the sidebar, providing easy access to all relevant implemented actions (like Load/Unload, View, Lock/Unlock for clusters, Create Sub-cluster, and Delete items), so I can manage my project components efficiently.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Review all functionalities implemented up to Sprint 2.3.

            Update the context menu for scan items in SidebarView to include:

                "Load Scan" / "Unload Scan" (dynamically shown based on current state).

                "View Point Cloud."

                "Delete Scan" (with a confirmation dialog).

            Update the context menu for cluster items in SidebarView to include:

                "Load All Scans in Cluster" / "Unload All Scans in Cluster" (dynamically shown).

                "View Point Cloud" (loads all scans in cluster for viewing).

                "Lock Cluster" / "Unlock Cluster" (dynamically shown).

                "New Cluster" (to create a sub-cluster under the selected cluster).

                "Delete Cluster" (with a confirmation dialog).

            Implement the "Delete Scan" backend logic:

                Prompt user with a confirmation dialog (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete scan '[scan_name]'? This action cannot be undone.").

                If confirmed, remove the scan's record from the SQLite Scans table.

                If the scan's import_type was "COPIED" or "MOVED", prompt the user again (optional, separate confirmation) if they also want to delete the physical scan file from the project's Scans subfolder.

                Update the ProjectTreeModel to remove the scan item.

            Implement the "Delete Cluster" backend logic:

                Prompt user with a confirmation dialog (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete cluster '[cluster_name]' and all its contents? This action cannot be undone.").

                If confirmed:

                    Recursively delete all sub-clusters and their contained scans (records from SQLite and optionally physical files for copied/moved scans, following the same prompting logic as "Delete Scan").

                    Remove the cluster's record from the SQLite Clusters table.

                Update the ProjectTreeModel to remove the cluster item and its children.

            Ensure all context menu actions are enabled/disabled appropriately based on item type and current state (e.g., "Unload Scan" only enabled if scan is loaded).

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menus) -> ProjectManager / ClusterManager / ScanManager (new module for scan-specific operations or within ProjectManager).

            Managers -> SQLiteManager (for DELETE operations on Scans and Clusters tables, and recursive queries for cluster contents).

            Managers -> File System (for optional deletion of physical scan files).

            Managers -> ProjectTreeModel (to notify of item removal).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Right-clicking a scan item shows: "Load Scan" or "Unload Scan", "View Point Cloud", "Delete Scan".

            Right-clicking a cluster item shows: "Load All..." or "Unload All...", "View Point Cloud", "Lock Cluster" or "Unlock Cluster", "New Cluster", "Delete Cluster".

            "Delete Scan" action, after confirmation, removes the scan from the sidebar and its record from SQLite. If scan file was COPIED/MOVED, user is prompted to optionally delete the physical file.

            "Delete Cluster" action, after confirmation, removes the cluster, all its sub-clusters, and all contained scans from the sidebar and SQLite. Physical files for COPIED/MOVED scans within are handled with optional user prompt for deletion.

            Context menu actions are correctly enabled/disabled based on the item's current state (e.g., "Unload" is disabled for an unloaded scan).

            Confirmation dialogs are displayed before any delete operation.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Test context menu for an unloaded scan. Verify options and states.

            Test Case 3.2: Test context menu for a loaded scan. Verify options and states.

            Test Case 3.3: Test "Delete Scan" (COPIED file). Confirm deletion. Choose to delete physical file. Verify UI, SQLite, and file system.

            Test Case 3.4: Test "Delete Scan" (LINKED file). Confirm deletion. Verify physical file is not prompted for deletion and remains.

            Test Case 3.5: Test context menu for an unlocked, unloaded cluster. Verify options.

            Test Case 3.6: Test context menu for a locked, partially loaded cluster. Verify options.

            Test Case 3.7: Test "Delete Cluster" containing scans and sub-clusters. Confirm deletion. Verify UI, SQLite, and (for copied/moved scans) file system changes.

            Test Case 3.8: Test cancelling a delete operation from the confirmation dialog. Verify no changes occur.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 2.3 Overall)

    UI Design: Design icons for locked/unlocked states. Finalize wording for confirmation dialogs.

    Database Schema Update: Add is_locked column to Clusters table in project_data.sqlite.

    Module Enhancement:

        Enhance ClusterManager (or ProjectManager) to handle setting/getting is_locked status in SQLite, and to manage cluster deletion (including recursive deletion of contents).

        Enhance ScanManager (or ProjectManager) to handle scan deletion (SQLite record and optional physical file).

        Enhance ProjectTreeModel to fetch and display lock status, and to correctly handle item removal upon deletion signals from managers.

        Enhance SidebarView to dynamically enable/disable context menu items and show appropriate text (e.g., "Load" vs "Unload").

        Enhance SQLiteManager with DML for updating is_locked, and DML for deleting scans and clusters (potentially cascading or requiring multiple queries for recursive deletion).

    Implementation: Develop the features outlined in the user stories.

    Unit Testing:

        ClusterManager: Test setting/clearing lock status in SQLite. Test cluster deletion logic (recursive removal from DB).

        ScanManager: Test scan deletion logic (DB record, optional file deletion).

        SQLiteManager: Test queries for updating lock status, deleting scans, deleting clusters and their contents.

    Integration Testing: Test full lifecycle: Create cluster -> Lock it -> Verify UI and DB -> Unlock -> Verify. Create cluster with scans -> Delete cluster -> Verify all parts removed.

4. References between Files

    SidebarView (context menus) -> ProjectManager / ClusterManager / ScanManager

    ProjectManager / ClusterManager / ScanManager -> SQLiteManager (for DML on Clusters.is_locked, DELETE from Scans, DELETE from Clusters)

    SQLiteManager -> project_data.sqlite

    ProjectTreeModel <- SQLiteManager (for is_locked status)

    ProjectTreeModel / SidebarItemDelegate -> SidebarView (for lock icon display)

    Managers -> File System (for optional physical deletion of scan files when a scan/cluster is deleted).

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    File 1: project_data.sqlite (Schema for Clusters table modified)

        Purpose: To store structured data about scans, clusters, hierarchy, and future registration information for a project.

        Contents (Sprint 2.3 focus - Clusters table modification):

            Clusters table (Modified):

                cluster_id (TEXT, PK)

                project_id (TEXT)

                cluster_name (TEXT)

                parent_cluster_id (TEXT, NULLABLE, FK to Clusters.cluster_id)

                creation_date (TEXT)

                is_locked (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT 0, NOT NULL): New field to store lock state.

        Relationships: Clusters.is_locked field is new. Logic for deleting records from Scans and Clusters will be implemented.

    Code Files (Illustrative, additions/modifications):

        ClusterManager.h/.cpp (or ProjectManager) (Modified): Add methods for setLockStatus(clusterId, isLocked), deleteCluster(clusterId, deletePhysicalFiles).

        ScanManager.h/.cpp (or ProjectManager) (New/Modified): Add method deleteScan(scanId, deletePhysicalFile).

        ProjectTreeModel.h/.cpp (Modified): Fetch is_locked for clusters. Handle signals for item removal. Logic to determine enabled/disabled state of context menu items.

        SidebarWidget.h/.cpp (Modified): Context menus significantly expanded. Logic to show/hide "Lock" vs "Unlock" based on model data.

        SQLiteManager.h/.cpp (Modified): Add DDL for is_locked column (with migration considerations). Add DML for updating is_locked. Add DML for deleting scans and for recursively deleting clusters and their associated scans.

        ConfirmationDialog.h/.cpp (Potentially New): A reusable dialog for "Are you sure?" prompts.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 2.3 Overall)

    Users can lock and unlock clusters via the sidebar context menu.

    The sidebar displays a clear visual indicator (e.g., a lock icon) for locked clusters, and this updates dynamically.

    Context menus for scans and clusters in the sidebar are comprehensive, offering all relevant actions implemented to date (Load/Unload, View, Lock/Unlock, New (Sub-)Cluster, Delete).

    Users can delete individual scans, with an option to also delete the physical scan file if it was copied/moved into the project.

    Users can delete clusters, which also removes all contained sub-clusters and scans (with appropriate handling/prompting for physical files).

    All delete operations present a confirmation dialog before proceeding.

    Context menu actions are correctly enabled/disabled based on the item's type and state.

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        ClusterManager/ProjectManager:

            Test setLockStatus correctly updates SQLite.

            Test deleteCluster logic: verify recursive deletion from SQLite, verify calls to delete physical files (mock file system interaction).

        ScanManager/ProjectManager:

            Test deleteScan logic: verify SQLite record deletion, verify calls to optionally delete physical file.

        SQLiteManager: Test SQL queries for updating is_locked, deleting single scans, deleting a cluster and all its child scans/clusters.

        ProjectTreeModel: Test that data roles for lock status are correctly exposed. Test model updates correctly after deletion signals.

    Integration Tests:

        Lock cluster -> Save project -> Reopen -> Verify lock state persists visually and in context menu.

        Delete a scan (copied) -> Choose to delete physical file -> Verify UI, SQLite, and file system.

        Delete a cluster (containing linked and moved scans) -> Verify UI, SQLite, and appropriate handling of physical files.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S2.3.1: Lock/Unlock Cluster and Visual Indicator.

            Test Data: A project with several clusters.

            Expected Result: Right-click cluster -> "Lock Cluster". Lock icon appears. Right-click again -> "Unlock Cluster". Lock icon disappears. State persists after save/reload.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S2.3.2: Comprehensive Scan Context Menu.

            Test Data: Loaded scan, unloaded scan.

            Expected Result: Verify all options (Load/Unload, View, Delete) appear and are enabled/disabled correctly. Test "Delete Scan" (with and without physical file deletion for copied/moved scans).

            Testing Tool: Manual, File Explorer, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S2.3.3: Comprehensive Cluster Context Menu.

            Test Data: Unlocked/unloaded cluster, locked/loaded cluster.

            Expected Result: Verify all options (Load/Unload All, View, Lock/Unlock, New Cluster, Delete) appear and are enabled/disabled correctly. Test "Delete Cluster".

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S2.3.4: Delete Cluster with Nested Content.

            Test Data: A cluster containing multiple scans (some copied, some linked) and sub-clusters which also contain scans.

            Expected Result: User is prompted for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the entire cluster, its sub-clusters, and all contained scan references are removed from UI and SQLite. User is prompted appropriately for physical deletion of relevant scan files.

            Testing Tool: Manual, File Explorer, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S2.3.5: Cancel Delete Operations.

            Test Data: Any scan or cluster.

            Expected Result: Initiating "Delete Scan" or "Delete Cluster" shows a confirmation. Clicking "Cancel" results in no changes to UI, SQLite, or file system.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint 2.2 functionalities (all import options, comprehensive SQLite Scans table, sidebar sourcing from SQLite) are completed and stable.

        Basic context menu infrastructure is in place from previous sprints.

    Dependencies:

        GUI Framework (e.g., Qt 6) for context menus, dialogs, icon display.

        SQLite library for database modifications (DML for updates and deletes, DDL for is_locked column).

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        Locking/unlocking a cluster (SQLite update and UI refresh) should be instantaneous.

        Deleting a single scan or an empty cluster should be very fast.

        Deleting a cluster with many items might take a few seconds (due to recursive DB operations and potential file deletions); consider a non-modal progress indicator if it exceeds 2-3 seconds.

    Usability:

        Lock icons must be clear and unambiguous.

        Confirmation dialogs for deletion must clearly state what will be deleted and that the action is irreversible.

        Context menus should be well-organized and not overly cluttered.

    Data Integrity:

        Deletion of clusters must correctly handle all child scans and sub-clusters in the database to avoid orphaned records or referential integrity issues (if FKs are used).

        Optional physical file deletion should only occur after explicit user confirmation for that step.

    Reliability:

        Application should not crash if attempting to delete a cluster that is in a partially loaded state or has ongoing operations (though such scenarios might be blocked by UI logic).

10. Conclusion

Sprint 2.3 significantly enhances the user's ability to manage and organize their project by introducing cluster locking and comprehensive delete functionalities via expanded context menus. These features provide greater control and safety when working with complex project structures. The visual feedback for lock states further improves the clarity of the project sidebar. Successful completion of this sprint will result in a more mature and user-empowering project management interface.
