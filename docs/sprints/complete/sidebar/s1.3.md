Sprint 1.3 Backlog: Cluster Creation & Scan Organization
1. Introduction

This document details the backlog for Sprint 1.3 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. Following the successful implementation of scan import and basic SQLite storage in Sprint 1.2, this sprint focuses on enabling users to organize their imported scans hierarchically using clusters (folders) and sub-clusters within the project sidebar. Key functionalities include creating clusters, creating sub-clusters, storing this hierarchy and scan membership in the SQLite database, and allowing users to drag and drop scans into these clusters. This sprint is essential for providing users with robust project organization capabilities.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Create New Cluster (Folder) in Sidebar

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to create new clusters (folders) directly in the project sidebar (e.g., under the project root or under an existing cluster), so I can logically group my scans.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a context menu option (e.g., "New Cluster" or "Create Folder") when right-clicking on the project root item or an existing cluster item in the SidebarView.

            Upon selecting this option, prompt the user for a cluster name (e.g., via an inline editor in the tree or a small dialog).

            Validate the cluster name (e.g., prevent empty names or names with invalid characters, ensure uniqueness within the parent).

            Implement logic in ProjectManager (or a new ClusterManager) to add a new cluster record to the SQLite Clusters table. This record should include a unique cluster_id, the provided name, parent_cluster_id (null if under project root, or the ID of the parent cluster), and creation_date.

            Update the ProjectTreeModel to reflect the new cluster, causing the SidebarView to display the new cluster at the correct hierarchical level.

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (context menu) -> ProjectManager / ClusterManager.

            ProjectManager / ClusterManager -> SQLiteManager (to insert into Clusters table).

            ProjectManager / ClusterManager -> ProjectTreeModel (to notify of new cluster).

            ProjectTreeModel -> SidebarView (for UI refresh).

            SQLite Clusters table will store parent-child relationships.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can right-click on the project root in the sidebar and select "New Cluster."

            User can right-click on an existing cluster in the sidebar and select "New Cluster" (to create a sub-cluster).

            User is prompted for a cluster name.

            A new cluster with the given name appears in the sidebar at the correct hierarchical position.

            A corresponding record is created in the SQLite Clusters table with a unique ID, the name, and the correct parent_cluster_id.

            Basic name validation (e.g., not empty) is performed.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Create a new cluster under the project root. Verify UI and SQLite.

            Test Case 1.2: Create a sub-cluster under an existing cluster. Verify UI and SQLite (check parent_cluster_id).

            Test Case 1.3: Create multiple clusters at the same level.

            Test Case 1.4: Create deeply nested clusters (e.g., 3-4 levels).

            Test Case 1.5: Attempt to create a cluster with an empty name (expect error/prevention).

            Test Case 1.6: Attempt to create a cluster with the same name as a sibling cluster (expect error/prevention or automatic renaming if that's the design).

    User Story 2: Store and Display Cluster Hierarchy from SQLite

        Description: As a developer, I need the application to correctly store the cluster hierarchy (parent-child relationships) in the SQLite database and for the ProjectTreeModel to accurately represent this hierarchy in the SidebarView when a project is opened.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Ensure the Clusters table in SQLite has a parent_cluster_id column that can be NULL (for top-level clusters under the project root) or reference another cluster_id (for sub-clusters).

            When creating clusters, ensure the parent_cluster_id is correctly populated in the SQLite Clusters table.

            Modify ProjectTreeModel to fetch cluster data (including hierarchy) from the SQLite Clusters table when a project is loaded.

            Implement logic in ProjectTreeModel to reconstruct and display the hierarchical tree structure based on the parent_cluster_id relationships.

        References between Files:

            ProjectTreeModel -> SQLiteManager (to query Clusters table).

            SQLiteManager -> project_data.sqlite (Clusters table).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The parent_cluster_id in the SQLite Clusters table correctly reflects the hierarchical structure created by the user.

            When a project is opened, the sidebar accurately displays the previously created cluster hierarchy, including nested sub-clusters, by reading from SQLite.

            The order of clusters at the same level is maintained (e.g., based on creation time or name).

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Create a project with multiple top-level clusters and nested sub-clusters. Save and reopen the project. Verify the hierarchy is perfectly restored in the sidebar.

            Test Case 2.2: Inspect the SQLite Clusters table to confirm parent_cluster_id values are correct for the created hierarchy.

    User Story 3: Store Scan Membership within Clusters in SQLite

        Description: As a developer, I need to store which scans belong to which cluster in the SQLite database, so this relationship is persisted and can be displayed correctly.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Add a parent_cluster_id column to the SQLite Scans table (created in Sprint 1.2). This column will be NULL if the scan is directly under the project root, or will reference a cluster_id from the Clusters table.

            When scans are imported (initially, as per Sprint 1.2, they might go to a default location/root), their parent_cluster_id in the Scans table should be set accordingly (e.g., NULL or ID of a default "Unassigned Scans" cluster if that design is chosen).

            Modify ProjectTreeModel to fetch scans associated with each cluster from the SQLite Scans table (using parent_cluster_id) when populating the sidebar.

        References between Files:

            ProjectTreeModel -> SQLiteManager (to query Scans table based on parent_cluster_id).

            SQLiteManager -> project_data.sqlite (Scans table and Clusters table).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The Scans table in SQLite includes a parent_cluster_id column.

            When a project with scans (imported in Sprint 1.2, likely at root for now) is opened, these scans are displayed under the correct parent (project root initially) in the sidebar by querying SQLite.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Open a project with scans imported in Sprint 1.2. Verify scans are displayed (likely under project root for now).

            Test Case 3.2: Inspect the SQLite Scans table to verify parent_cluster_id is NULL (or a default value) for these initially imported scans.

    User Story 4: Drag and Drop Scans into Clusters/Sub-folders

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to drag one or more selected scans from their current location in the sidebar and drop them into a different cluster or sub-folder, so I can organize my scans efficiently.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Enable drag-and-drop functionality in the SidebarView (QTreeView).

            Implement logic to identify the dragged items (scans) and the drop target (cluster).

            Upon a successful drop operation:

                Update the parent_cluster_id for the affected scan(s) in the SQLite Scans table to the cluster_id of the target cluster.

                Refresh the ProjectTreeModel to reflect the changes in the SidebarView (scans should move to the new cluster).

            Provide visual feedback during drag (e.g., what is being dragged) and drop (e.g., highlighting valid drop targets).

            Prevent dropping scans onto other scans (only onto clusters or project root).

        References between Files:

            SidebarView (handles drag/drop events) -> ProjectTreeModel (to initiate data update).

            ProjectTreeModel -> ProjectManager / ClusterManager (to update scan's parent cluster).

            ProjectManager / ClusterManager -> SQLiteManager (to update parent_cluster_id in Scans table).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can select one or more scans in the sidebar.

            User can drag the selected scan(s) and drop them onto a cluster or sub-cluster node.

            Upon dropping, the scan(s) disappear from their original location and appear under the target cluster in the sidebar.

            The parent_cluster_id for the moved scan(s) in the SQLite Scans table is updated to the ID of the target cluster.

            Dragging a scan onto another scan is not permitted.

            Visual feedback is provided during the drag-and-drop operation.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 4.1: Drag a single scan from project root to a cluster. Verify UI and SQLite update.

            Test Case 4.2: Drag multiple selected scans to a different cluster. Verify UI and SQLite.

            Test Case 4.3: Drag scans into a nested sub-cluster. Verify UI and SQLite.

            Test Case 4.4: Drag scans back to the project root (parent_cluster_id becomes NULL).

            Test Case 4.5: Attempt to drag a scan onto another scan item (should fail or be disallowed).

            Test Case 4.6: Test drag-and-drop with a large number of scans to check for UI responsiveness.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 1.3 Overall)

    UI/UX Design: Refine context menu designs for cluster creation. Design visual feedback for drag-and-drop operations.

    Database Schema Update:

        Add parent_cluster_id (nullable, foreign key to Clusters.cluster_id) to the Clusters table.

        Add parent_cluster_id (nullable, foreign key to Clusters.cluster_id) to the Scans table.

    Module Enhancement:

        Enhance ProjectManager (or create ClusterManager) for cluster creation and managing scan-to-cluster relationships.

        Significantly enhance ProjectTreeModel to:

            Fetch and reconstruct the full cluster/scan hierarchy from SQLite.

            Handle adding new clusters.

            Handle moving scans between clusters (model updates reflecting SQLite changes).

        Enhance SQLiteManager with queries for:

            Inserting new clusters.

            Fetching cluster hierarchy.

            Fetching scans by parent_cluster_id.

            Updating parent_cluster_id for scans.

    Implementation: Develop the features outlined in the user stories, focusing on SQLite as the source of truth for hierarchy and membership.

    Unit Testing: Write unit tests for:

        ClusterManager: Cluster creation logic, SQLite interaction for clusters.

        SQLiteManager: Queries related to cluster hierarchy and scan membership.

        ProjectTreeModel: Logic for building tree from hierarchical SQLite data, and updating model after drag-drop.

    Integration Testing:

        Test complete flow: Create project -> Import scans -> Create clusters -> Drag scans into clusters -> Save project -> Close and reopen -> Verify entire structure and scan placement is restored correctly from SQLite.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 1.3 Overall)

    Users can create new clusters and sub-clusters in the sidebar.

    The cluster hierarchy (parent-child relationships) is correctly stored in the SQLite Clusters table.

    Scans can be dragged and dropped into any cluster or sub-cluster, and this membership is correctly stored in the parent_cluster_id field of the Scans table in SQLite.

    When a project is opened, the sidebar accurately reconstructs and displays the full hierarchy of clusters and their member scans from the SQLite database.

    Basic error handling for cluster naming (e.g., preventing duplicates at the same level) is implemented.

    Drag-and-drop operations provide appropriate visual feedback and update both the UI and the database.

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        ClusterManager/ProjectManager: Test cluster creation (SQLite record insertion, parent_cluster_id correctness), scan movement logic (SQLite Scans.parent_cluster_id update).

        SQLiteManager: Test all new/modified queries for clusters and scan membership. Test hierarchical data retrieval.

        ProjectTreeModel: Test building the tree from a complex hierarchical dataset fetched from a mock SQLite source. Test model updates post drag-and-drop.

    Integration Tests:

        Create a project, import scans, create a multi-level cluster hierarchy, drag scans into various clusters. Save, close, and reopen. Verify the exact structure is restored.

        Test moving scans between different levels of the hierarchy.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S1.3.1: Create top-level cluster.

            Test Data: N/A.

            Expected Result: Cluster appears in sidebar under project root. SQLite Clusters table has new record with parent_cluster_id as NULL.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S1.3.2: Create sub-cluster.

            Test Data: Existing top-level cluster.

            Expected Result: Sub-cluster appears under parent cluster. SQLite Clusters table has new record with parent_cluster_id referencing the parent.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S1.3.3: Drag and drop single scan into a cluster.

            Test Data: One imported scan, one empty cluster.

            Expected Result: Scan moves in sidebar. SQLite Scans table updates parent_cluster_id for that scan.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S1.3.4: Drag and drop multiple scans into a sub-cluster.

            Test Data: Multiple selected scans, one empty sub-cluster.

            Expected Result: All selected scans move. SQLite records for all scans updated.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S1.3.5: Persistence of cluster structure.

            Test Data: Project with scans organized into a 3-level deep cluster hierarchy.

            Expected Result: Save, close, and reopen project. The exact sidebar structure is restored.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S1.3.6: Attempt to create cluster with duplicate name under same parent.

            Test Data: Create "ClusterA". Attempt to create another "ClusterA" under the same parent.

            Expected Result: Error message or automatic renaming (e.g., "ClusterA (1)"). Database integrity maintained.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint 1.2 functionalities (scan import with copy/move, basic SQLite Scans table) are completed and stable.

        The GUI framework supports robust drag-and-drop within its tree view component.

        UUIDs can be reliably generated for scan_id and cluster_id.

    Dependencies:

        SQLite library and its integration with the application (established in Sprint 1.2).

        GUI Framework (e.g., Qt 6) for sidebar tree view, context menus, drag-and-drop.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        Creating a new cluster should be instantaneous.

        Drag-and-drop of a small number of scans should feel instantaneous.

        Loading a project with a moderately complex cluster hierarchy (e.g., 50 clusters, 100 scans total) should populate the sidebar quickly (e.g., < 1-2 seconds).

    Usability:

        Cluster creation via context menu should be intuitive.

        Drag-and-drop should provide clear visual cues for valid drop targets and the items being dragged.

    Data Integrity:

        SQLite database operations (inserts, updates for cluster creation and scan moves) must be transactional to ensure consistency.

        Foreign key constraints (e.g., Scans.parent_cluster_id to Clusters.cluster_id) should be considered for maintaining relational integrity, though initial implementation might rely on application logic.

    Scalability:

        The sidebar and underlying SQLite structure should be designed to handle hundreds of scans and dozens of clusters without significant performance degradation during load or interaction.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 1.3 is pivotal in providing users with the tools to organize their scan data effectively. By implementing cluster creation and drag-and-drop scan organization, backed by robust SQLite storage for the hierarchy and membership, the application will move significantly closer to a professional-grade project management tool. This organized structure is also a prerequisite for more advanced features like cluster-based registration and processing.
