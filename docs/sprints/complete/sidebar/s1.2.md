Sprint 1.2 Backlog: Scan Import & Initial SQLite Setup
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 1.2 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. Building upon the project creation and opening functionalities from Sprint 1.1, this sprint focuses on enabling users to import scan files into their projects. Key features include providing options for copying or moving scan files to the project folder, displaying these imported scans in the sidebar, and setting up the initial SQLite database structure to store basic scan metadata. This sprint is crucial for populating projects with actual data and preparing for more advanced data management.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Guided Scan Import Initiation

        Description: As a user, after creating a new project or opening an existing empty project, I want to be clearly guided or prompted to import scans, so I know the next logical step to populate my project.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Design UI element(s) to prompt or guide scan import (e.g., a prominent "Import Scans" button in an empty project view, a contextual tip, or an automatic dialog if the project is empty after creation).

            Implement the logic to display this guidance when a new project is created or an empty project is opened.

            Ensure this guidance leads to the scan import functionality.

        References between Files:

            MainWindow (or equivalent main view controller) will check project state (e.g., number of scans) after project load.

            ProjectManager might provide information about project emptiness.

            UI guidance element will trigger the ScanImportDialog.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Upon creating a new, empty project, a clear visual cue or prompt to "Import Scans" is displayed.

            Upon opening an existing project that contains no scans, a similar clear visual cue or prompt is displayed.

            Interacting with this guidance initiates the scan import process.

            This guidance is not shown if the project already contains scans.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Create a new project and verify the "Import Scans" guidance appears.

            Test Case 1.2: Create a project, import a scan, close and reopen the project. Verify guidance does not appear.

            Test Case 1.3: Manually create an empty project structure (folder + basic JSON) and open it. Verify guidance appears.

    User Story 2: Scan File Import with "Copy" and "Move" Options

        Description: As a user, I want to import scan files (.las, .e57) into my active project, with the option to either copy the files into the project folder or move them, so I can manage my source files according to my workflow.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a ScanImportDialog that allows users to select one or more scan files (.las, .e57) using a system file dialog.

            The dialog must present options: "Copy to Project Folder" and "Move to Project Folder."

            Implement backend logic in ProjectManager (or a new ScanImportManager) to handle the file operations:

                Copy: Copy selected files into a designated Scans subfolder within the project directory. Original files remain untouched.

                Move: Move selected files into the Scans subfolder. Original files are removed from their source location.

            Implement progress indication for file operations, especially for large files or multiple files.

            Handle potential errors during file operations (e.g., file not found, insufficient permissions, disk full) and provide user feedback.

        References between Files:

            MainWindow / SidebarWidget (or a menu/toolbar action) will trigger ScanImportDialog.

            ScanImportDialog will interact with ProjectManager / ScanImportManager.

            ProjectManager / ScanImportManager will interact with the File System to perform copy/move operations.

            Paths to the new scan files within the project folder will be recorded.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can initiate scan import from the UI.

            A dialog allows selection of multiple .las or .e57 files.

            Dialog provides clear "Copy to Project Folder" and "Move to Project Folder" options.

            Copy Option: Selected scan files are physically copied into the project's Scans subfolder; original files remain in their source location.

            Move Option: Selected scan files are physically moved into the project's Scans subfolder; original files are no longer in their source location.

            A progress indicator is shown during import.

            Appropriate error messages are displayed for file operation failures.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Import a single scan file using "Copy" option. Verify file in project folder and original is untouched.

            Test Case 2.2: Import multiple scan files using "Copy" option.

            Test Case 2.3: Import a single scan file using "Move" option. Verify file in project folder and original is gone.

            Test Case 2.4: Import multiple scan files using "Move" option.

            Test Case 2.5: Attempt to import a non-existent file (e.g., deleted after selection in dialog but before import starts).

            Test Case 2.6: Test import into a project on a drive with insufficient space (for copy).

    User Story 3: Display Imported Scans in Sidebar

        Description: As a user, after successfully importing scan files, I want to see them listed as items in the project sidebar, so I can view and manage them within the project structure.

        Actions to Undertake:

            After successful file import (copy/move), update the ProjectTreeModel to add new items representing the imported scans.

            Scans should initially appear under the project root or a default "Scans" folder (if such a convention is adopted).

            The sidebar should display the filename (without extension, or full name as per design choice) for each scan.

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager / ScanImportManager will notify ProjectTreeModel (or main controller) about newly imported scans.

            ProjectTreeModel will be updated, causing SidebarView to refresh.

            Scan metadata (ID, name, path) will be passed to the model.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Successfully imported scans appear as new items in the sidebar tree view.

            Scans are displayed with their names.

            The sidebar updates dynamically after the import operation completes.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Import one scan, verify it appears in the sidebar.

            Test Case 3.2: Import multiple scans, verify all appear in the sidebar.

            Test Case 3.3: Import scans into a project that already has other items in the sidebar; verify new scans are added correctly without disturbing existing items.

    User Story 4: Initial SQLite Database Setup and Basic Scan Storage

        Description: As a developer, I need the application to create and initialize an SQLite database (project_data.sqlite) when a new project is created, and store basic information for each imported scan, so that scan metadata is persisted.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement logic in ProjectManager to create a project_data.sqlite file in the root of a newly created project folder.

            Define and create an initial Scans table schema within the SQLite database:

                scan_id (TEXT, PRIMARY KEY) - e.g., UUID

                project_id (TEXT, FOREIGN KEY to a future Projects table if multi-project DB, or just for context)

                scan_name (TEXT) - User-friendly name, initially filename.

                file_path_relative (TEXT) - Path to the scan file relative to the project root (e.g., "Scans/scan1.las").

                import_type (TEXT) - e.g., "COPIED", "MOVED".

                date_added (TEXT, ISO 8601 Timestamp).

            Modify the scan import process: after a scan file is copied/moved to the project folder, a new record for this scan is inserted into the Scans table.

            When opening an existing project, the application should connect to this SQLite database.

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager will handle SQLite database creation and connection.

            ProjectManager / ScanImportManager will write new scan records to the Scans table in project_data.sqlite.

            project_meta.json might store the name/existence of the SQLite DB file for quick checks.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A project_data.sqlite file is created in the project folder when a new project is created.

            The Scans table is created in the SQLite database with the specified schema.

            Upon importing a scan (copy/move), a corresponding record is added to the Scans table with correct scan_id, scan_name, file_path_relative, import_type, and date_added.

            The application can successfully connect to the SQLite database when an existing project is opened.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 4.1: Create a new project. Verify project_data.sqlite is created. Use an SQLite browser to verify Scans table schema.

            Test Case 4.2: Import a scan using "Copy". Verify a new record is added to Scans table with correct details (especially file_path_relative and import_type="COPIED").

            Test Case 4.3: Import a scan using "Move". Verify a new record is added to Scans table with correct details (especially file_path_relative and import_type="MOVED").

            Test Case 4.4: Open an existing project with an SQLite DB. Verify connection is established (e.g., by attempting a simple query or checking application logs).

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 1.2 Overall)

    UI Design: Design ScanImportDialog and any UI elements for guiding scan import.

    Module Enhancement/Creation:

        Enhance ProjectManager (or create ScanImportManager) for scan import logic and SQLite interaction.

        Enhance ProjectTreeModel to accept and display scan items.

        Create SQLiteManager (or integrate into ProjectManager) for database operations (creation, table setup, insertion).

    Implementation: Develop the features outlined in the user stories.

    Database Schema: Finalize and implement the initial Scans table schema in SQLite.

    Unit Testing: Write unit tests for file copy/move logic, SQLite record insertion, and scan import guidance logic.

    Integration Testing: Test the complete flow of creating a project, being guided to import, importing scans (copy/move), scans appearing in sidebar, and data being stored in SQLite.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 1.2 Overall)

    Users are guided to import scans after project creation if the project is empty.

    Users can successfully import .las and .e57 scan files using "Copy to Project Folder" and "Move to Project Folder" options.

    Imported scans are correctly added to the project's Scans subfolder (for copy/move).

    Imported scans are displayed by name in the project sidebar.

    A project_data.sqlite file is created for new projects.

    The Scans table is created in the SQLite database with the correct schema.

    Basic metadata for each imported scan (ID, name, relative path, import type) is stored in the Scans table of the SQLite database.

    File operation errors during import are handled gracefully with user feedback.

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        ScanImportManager/ProjectManager: Test file copy logic, file move logic, error handling for invalid paths or permissions.

        SQLiteManager: Test database creation, Scans table creation, insertion of scan records, retrieval of scan records.

    Integration Tests:

        Test flow: Project created -> Guidance shown -> User initiates import -> Selects files -> Chooses "Copy" -> Files copied, SQLite updated, Sidebar updated.

        Test flow: Project created -> Guidance shown -> User initiates import -> Selects files -> Chooses "Move" -> Files moved, SQLite updated, Sidebar updated.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S1.2.1: Import guidance after new project creation.

            Test Data: Create new project.

            Expected Result: UI prompts/guides user to import scans. Clicking guidance opens scan import dialog.

            Expected Result: All scans imported correctly, appear in sidebar, records in SQLite. Progress indication shown.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprint 1.1 functionalities (Project Hub, project creation/opening, basic sidebar) are completed and stable.

        The application has necessary file system permissions for copy and move operations.

        Scan files to be imported are valid and not corrupted.

    Dependencies:

        GUI Framework (e.g., Qt 6) for dialogs, file operations, sidebar view.

        SQLite library (e.g., Qt SQL module or a standalone SQLite C++ wrapper).

        JSON library (from Sprint 1.1).

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance:

        Scan import dialog should open quickly.

        File selection dialog should be responsive.

        Copy/Move operations should provide progress for files > ~50-100MB or for batches of multiple files.

        Sidebar update after import should be near-instantaneous for a reasonable number of scans.

        SQLite database creation and initial table setup should be very fast.

    Usability:

        The scan import dialog and options ("Copy", "Move") must be clear and unambiguous.

        User guidance for importing scans into an empty project should be noticeable and helpful.

    Reliability:

        File copy/move operations must be robust. If an operation fails mid-way for a batch, already processed files should remain, and an error reported for the failed ones.

        SQLite transactions should be used for database writes to ensure atomicity, especially when adding multiple scans.

    Data Integrity:

        Paths stored in SQLite must accurately reflect the location of the scan files within the project.

        import_type must be correctly recorded.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 1.2 is a significant step towards making the application useful by allowing users to bring their data into the managed project environment. It introduces file operations and the initial use of an SQLite database for structured data storage, both of which are foundational for future features like detailed scan metadata management, cluster organization, and registration. Clear user guidance on scan import will also improve the initial user experience.
