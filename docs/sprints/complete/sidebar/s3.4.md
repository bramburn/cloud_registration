Sprint 3.4 Backlog: Advanced Memory Management Teaser & Basic Registration Data Storage
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 3.4 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. This sprint is designated as optional or time-permitting within Phase 3. It aims to explore preliminary aspects of advanced memory management through a Level of Detail (LOD) prototype and by displaying basic memory usage statistics. Additionally, it involves extending the SQLite database schema to prepare for storing registration status and transformation matrices, which are foundational for future registration functionalities. This sprint serves as a "teaser" for more advanced capabilities and sets up the database for upcoming development.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Prototype Basic Level of Detail (LOD) for Point Cloud Display

        Description: As a user interacting with a very large point cloud or on a system with limited resources, I want the application to be able to display a less dense version (a basic LOD) of the point cloud, either automatically based on distance or via a manual setting, so that I can maintain reasonable viewing performance and responsiveness.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Research and select a simple LOD strategy for prototyping (e.g., random percentage-based subsampling, or a very basic distance-based thinning where farther points are more sparse).

            Implement the chosen LOD algorithm within the PointCloudLoadManager or PointCloudViewerWidget. This algorithm should take the full point cloud data as input and output a subsampled version.

            Add a mechanism (e.g., a debug menu option, a simple UI toggle, or an automatic trigger if viewing distance is large) to enable/disable or adjust this basic LOD.

            Modify the PointCloudViewerWidget to render the subsampled point cloud when LOD is active.

            Focus on a proof-of-concept rather than a fully optimized or visually seamless LOD system.

        References between Files:

            PointCloudLoadManager (may apply subsampling before passing data).

            PointCloudViewerWidget (renders the potentially subsampled data, may contain LOD logic or settings).

            Potentially a new LODManager utility class.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A basic LOD mechanism (e.g., random 50% subsampling) can be triggered.

            When LOD is active, the viewer displays a visibly less dense point cloud compared to the full data.

            The application can switch between rendering the full point cloud and the LOD version.

            The prototype demonstrates a noticeable performance improvement (e.g., higher FPS or faster load-to-render time for the LOD version) with a large test scan.

            The LOD implementation does not introduce significant visual artifacts beyond the expected reduction in density for this prototype stage.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Load a large scan. Activate LOD. Verify visually reduced density.

            Test Case 1.2: Toggle LOD on/off. Verify viewer updates correctly.

            Test Case 1.3: (Informal) Compare rendering frame rate or perceived responsiveness with LOD on vs. LOD off for a large scan.

            Test Case 1.4: If distance-based LOD is prototyped, verify density changes as camera zooms in/out.

    User Story 2: Display Basic Memory Usage Statistics

        Description: As a user, I want to see a basic indication of how much memory is currently being used by the loaded point cloud(s), so I can get a sense of the application's resource consumption.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a mechanism in PointCloudLoadManager to estimate or track the memory footprint of currently loaded point cloud data (e.g., based on number of points * bytes per point).

            Design a simple UI element to display this information (e.g., a label in the status bar or a dedicated section in a diagnostics panel).

            The UI element should update when point clouds are loaded or unloaded.

            Display memory usage in a user-friendly unit (e.g., MB or GB).

        References between Files:

            PointCloudLoadManager (calculates/tracks memory usage).

            MainWindow (or a status bar component) will display the memory usage information.

            PointCloudLoadManager will need to signal MainWindow (or an intermediary controller) when usage changes.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A UI element displays the estimated memory usage of currently loaded point clouds.

            The displayed value updates when scans are loaded.

            The displayed value updates (decreases or goes to zero) when scans are unloaded.

            Memory is displayed in MB or GB.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Load a scan. Verify memory usage is displayed and seems reasonable for the scan size.

            Test Case 2.2: Load multiple scans. Verify memory usage increases.

            Test Case 2.3: Unload some/all scans. Verify memory usage decreases accordingly.

            Test Case 2.4: Load a cluster. Verify memory usage reflects all scans in the cluster.

    User Story 3: Extend SQLite Schema for Basic Registration Data Storage

        Description: As a developer, I need to extend the project's SQLite database schema to include tables for storing registration status and transformation matrices for scans and clusters, so that future registration features have a persistent place to store their results.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Define the schema for a new RegistrationStatus table in project_data.sqlite:

                item_id (TEXT, PK) - Foreign Key referencing Scans.scan_id or Clusters.cluster_id.

                item_type (TEXT) - e.g., "SCAN" or "CLUSTER".

                status (TEXT) - e.g., "UNREGISTERED", "PROCESSING", "REGISTERED_MANUAL", "REGISTERED_AUTO", "FAILED_REGISTRATION", "NEEDS_REVIEW".

                error_metric_value (REAL, NULLABLE) - e.g., Mean registration error.

                error_metric_type (TEXT, NULLABLE) - e.g., "RMSE", "MeanTargetResidual".

                last_registration_date (TEXT, ISO 8601 Timestamp).

            Define the schema for a new TransformationMatrices table in project_data.sqlite:

                item_id (TEXT, PK) - Foreign Key referencing Scans.scan_id or Clusters.cluster_id.

                item_type (TEXT) - e.g., "SCAN" or "CLUSTER".

                matrix_m00 to matrix_m33 (REAL) - 16 fields for a 4x4 transformation matrix, or store as a serialized string/blob.

                relative_to_item_id (TEXT, NULLABLE) - FK to another item if relative, or NULL if relative to project origin.

                last_transform_date (TEXT, ISO 8601 Timestamp).

            Implement the DDL (Data Definition Language) in SQLiteManager to create these tables if they don't exist when a project is opened or created.

            (No data population in this sprint, just schema creation).

        References between Files:

            SQLiteManager (will contain DDL for new tables).

            project_data.sqlite (will have the new tables created).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When a new project is created, the project_data.sqlite database includes the RegistrationStatus table with the defined schema.

            When a new project is created, the project_data.sqlite database includes the TransformationMatrices table with the defined schema.

            When an existing project (created before this sprint) is opened, the application attempts to create these tables if they are missing (basic migration).

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Create a new project. Use an SQLite browser to verify the RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables exist with the correct columns and types.

            Test Case 3.2: Open a project created in a previous sprint (without these tables). Verify the tables are now created in its project_data.sqlite file.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 3.4 Overall)

    LOD Research & Prototyping: Investigate simple, quick-to-implement LOD techniques. Implement one as a prototype.

    Memory Tracking: Add basic memory estimation logic for loaded point clouds.

    UI for Memory Stats: Implement a simple display for memory usage.

    Database Schema Design: Finalize schemas for RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices.

    Database DDL Implementation: Write and integrate SQL DDL statements for creating the new tables.

    Testing: Focus on proof-of-concept for LOD, accuracy of memory display, and correct creation of new database tables.

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    File 1: project_data.sqlite (Schema extended)

        Purpose: To store structured data about scans, clusters, hierarchy, and registration information.

        Contents (Sprint 3.4 focus - new tables):

            RegistrationStatus table:

                item_id (TEXT, PK), item_type (TEXT), status (TEXT), error_metric_value (REAL, NULLABLE), error_metric_type (TEXT, NULLABLE), last_registration_date (TEXT).

            TransformationMatrices table:

                item_id (TEXT, PK), item_type (TEXT), matrix_m00...matrix_m33 (REAL or BLOB/TEXT for serialized matrix), relative_to_item_id (TEXT, NULLABLE), last_transform_date (TEXT).

        Relationships: These new tables will eventually link to Scans.scan_id and Clusters.cluster_id.

    Code Files (Illustrative, additions/modifications):

        PointCloudLoadManager.h/.cpp (Modified): May include logic for subsampling data for LOD. Will track memory of loaded clouds.

        PointCloudViewerWidget.h/.cpp (Modified): May include logic to request/render LOD data.

        LODManager.h/.cpp (Potentially New): If LOD logic becomes complex enough to warrant a separate utility.

        MemoryMonitor.h/.cpp (Potentially New): If memory tracking and display logic is centralized.

        SQLiteManager.h/.cpp (Modified): Add DDL statements to create RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables.

        MainWindow.h/.cpp (Modified): To add UI element for memory statistics display.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 3.4 Overall)

    A basic LOD prototype (e.g., random subsampling) is implemented and can be toggled, demonstrating a visual reduction in point density and a potential performance gain.

    Basic memory usage statistics for loaded point clouds are displayed in the UI and update with load/unload operations.

    The SQLite database schema is extended with RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables upon project creation or opening an older project.

    The primary focus is on proof-of-concept and schema preparation, not production-ready LOD or full registration data management.

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        PointCloudLoadManager: Test LOD subsampling logic (if implemented there) against a known dataset to verify point count reduction. Test memory estimation logic.

        SQLiteManager: Test DDL execution for creating new tables. Test that tables are created correctly on new DBs and added to existing DBs (if migration logic is in place).

    Integration Tests:

        Test flow: Load scan -> Activate LOD -> Verify viewer shows fewer points -> Deactivate LOD -> Verify viewer shows full cloud.

        Test flow: Load scan -> Verify memory stat updates -> Unload scan -> Verify memory stat updates.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S3.4.1: LOD Prototype Functionality.

            Test Data: A large scan file.

            Expected Result: User can trigger LOD. Viewer shows a sparser cloud. (Informal) User perceives better responsiveness or sees higher FPS.

            Testing Tool: Manual, application's FPS counter (if available).

        Test Case S3.4.2: Memory Usage Display.

            Test Data: Load and unload various scans of different sizes.

            Expected Result: Memory usage statistic in UI updates and provides a reasonable estimate of memory consumed by point data.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.4.3: SQLite Schema Extension - New Project.

            Test Data: Create a new project.

            Expected Result: project_data.sqlite contains RegistrationStatus and TransformationMatrices tables with the correct schema.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S3.4.4: SQLite Schema Extension - Existing Project.

            Test Data: Open a project created before this sprint (lacking the new tables).

            Expected Result: The new tables are added to the existing project_data.sqlite file.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprints up to 3.3 (UI/UX refinements, core data management, basic viewing) are completed and stable.

        A simple subsampling algorithm for LOD is sufficient for a "teaser" or prototype.

        Basic memory estimation (points * bytes/point) is acceptable for initial statistics.

        The application can modify the schema of an existing SQLite database (e.g., add tables if they don't exist) when opening older projects.

    Dependencies:

        GUI Framework (e.g., Qt 6) for any new UI elements (LOD toggle, memory display).

        SQLite library for DDL execution.

        Existing point cloud loading and rendering pipeline from Sprint 3.2.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance (LOD Prototype):

        Activating/deactivating the basic LOD should not cause significant freezes.

        The LOD version should render noticeably faster or with less resource consumption on very large test clouds.

    Accuracy (Memory Stats):

        Memory usage display should provide a ballpark figure; precise byte-level accuracy is not required for this teaser.

    Database Operations:

        Adding new tables to an existing database should be quick and not corrupt existing data.

    Usability:

        If an LOD toggle is provided, it should be easy to find and use.

        Memory statistics should be presented in an understandable format.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 3.4, while optional, provides valuable groundwork for future, more complex features. The LOD prototype offers an early look into performance optimization strategies for large datasets. Displaying memory usage enhances user awareness of resource consumption. Critically, extending the SQLite schema for registration data ensures that the database is prepared to support the upcoming core registration functionalities, making the transition to those development phases smoother. This sprint focuses on exploration and preparation rather than production-ready features in these specific areas.
