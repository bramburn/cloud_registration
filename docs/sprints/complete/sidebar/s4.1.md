Sprint 4.1 Backlog: Full Scan Metadata Extraction & Enhanced Project Info
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 4.1 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project, as defined in "Phase 4: Core Data Enhancement & Initial Registration Prep" of the main Product Requirements Document. The primary goals of this sprint are to implement automatic extraction of essential scan metadata (point count and bounding box) upon import and to enhance project-level information by enabling the storage of user-defined tags and coordinate systems within the project_meta.json file. This sprint will significantly enrich the data associated with each scan and project, providing a more robust foundation for future processing and management tasks.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Automatic Extraction of Scan Point Count & Bounding Box

        Description: As a user, when I import a scan file (.las, .e57), I want the application to automatically parse its header to determine the actual point count and calculate its spatial bounding box, so this accurate metadata is stored and available for project management and future processing.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Research Header Parsing Libraries/Techniques: Investigate and select appropriate methods or libraries (e.g., libLAS, LASlib for LAS; libE57Format for E57) for efficiently reading header information without loading the entire point cloud.

            Implement LAS Header Parser Utility:

                Create or enhance a utility (e.g., ScanFileHeaderParserLAS or within ScanImportManager) to open .las files in read-only mode.

                Extract the total number of point records from the LAS public header block.

                Extract the Min X, Max X, Min Y, Max Y, Min Z, Max Z fields from the LAS public header block to define the bounding box.

                Handle different LAS versions (1.2, 1.3, 1.4) and Point Data Record Formats (PDRFs) if they affect header metadata location or interpretation for these specific fields.

                Implement error handling for corrupted or incomplete LAS headers.

            Implement E57 Header Parser Utility:

                Create or enhance a utility (e.g., ScanFileHeaderParserE57 or within ScanImportManager) to open .e57 files.

                Navigate the E57 XML structure to find relevant data3D sections (scans).

                For each scan, extract the point count (e.g., from points/@recordCount in the CompressedVector node).

                Extract or calculate the bounding box for each scan (e.g., from cartesianBounds if available, or by iterating through a sample of points if necessary, though header-only is preferred). For this initial implementation, focus on declared bounds.

                Implement error handling for malformed E57 XML or missing metadata fields.

            Integrate Parsing into Scan Import Process:

                In ScanImportManager::createScanInfo (or equivalent method), after a file is selected for import and before it's committed to the database:

                    Call the appropriate header parser utility based on file extension.

                    Populate the point_count_estimate field of the ScanInfo struct with the actual point count extracted.

                    Populate the bounding_box_min_x, bounding_box_min_y, bounding_box_min_z, bounding_box_max_x, bounding_box_max_y, bounding_box_max_z fields of the ScanInfo struct with the extracted bounding box values.

            Update SQLite Storage:

                Ensure SQLiteManager::insertScan correctly saves these newly populated ScanInfo fields to the Scans table in project_data.sqlite.

        References between Files:

            ScanImportManager.h/.cpp: Will call new/updated header parsing utilities. Will populate ScanInfo struct with extracted data.

            ScanFileHeaderParserLAS.h/.cpp (New or Enhanced Utility): Contains logic for LAS header parsing. Interacts with the File System.

            ScanFileHeaderParserE57.h/.cpp (New or Enhanced Utility): Contains logic for E57 XML/header parsing. Interacts with the File System.

            SQLiteManager.h/.cpp: Scans table DML will store the point_count_estimate and bounding box fields.

            ProjectManager.h (Struct ScanInfo): Fields point_count_estimate, boundingBoxMinX, etc., will now hold actual data.

            project_data.sqlite: Scans table will store the extracted metadata.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            When a .las file is imported, its point_count_estimate in the SQLite Scans table accurately reflects the "Number of Point Records" from its header.

            When a .las file is imported, its bounding box fields in SQLite accurately reflect the Min/Max X/Y/Z values from its header.

            When an .e57 file is imported, its point_count_estimate in SQLite accurately reflects the sum of points from its data3D scan section(s) (or the first scan, if multi-scan handling is still basic).

            When an .e57 file is imported, its bounding box fields in SQLite accurately reflect the cartesianBounds (or equivalent) from its XML structure.

            The scan import process remains reasonably performant, with header parsing adding minimal overhead.

            If a scan file's header is unparsable for this metadata, the import process still completes (potentially with default/zero values for these fields) and logs a warning or informs the user.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Import various valid .las files (different PDRFs, versions 1.2-1.4) with known point counts and bounding box values.

                Test Data: Sample .las files with pre-verified header information (e.g., using CloudCompare or LAStools to check header).

                Expected Result: Scans table in SQLite contains the correct point count and bounding box for each imported LAS file.

                Testing Tool: Manual import, SQLite Browser, debugging.

            Test Case 1.2: Import various valid .e57 files (single scan, multiple scans if applicable for point count aggregation) with known point counts and bounding boxes.

                Test Data: Sample .e57 files with pre-verified header/XML information.

                Expected Result: Scans table in SQLite contains the correct point count and bounding box for each imported E57 file.

                Testing Tool: Manual import, SQLite Browser, debugging.

            Test Case 1.3: Attempt to import a .las file with a corrupted or missing header section relevant to point count/bbox.

                Test Data: A .las file where header fields for point count or extents are intentionally zeroed out or made unreadable.

                Expected Result: Import completes, scan is added to project, but point_count_estimate and bounding box fields in SQLite are set to default values (e.g., 0). A warning is logged. Application does not crash.

                Testing Tool: Manual import, SQLite Browser, application logs.

            Test Case 1.4: Attempt to import an .e57 file with malformed XML for point count or cartesianBounds.

                Test Data: An .e57 file with its XML structure for point count or bounds intentionally broken.

                Expected Result: Similar to Test Case 1.3 â€“ import completes with defaults for affected metadata, warning logged, no crash.

                Testing Tool: Manual import, SQLite Browser, application logs.

            Test Case 1.5: Performance test for header parsing.

                Test Data: A set of 10 large scan files.

                Expected Result: The additional time taken for header parsing during import is minimal (e.g., adds less than 0.5 seconds per file on average).

                Testing Tool: Manual import with stopwatch/profiler.

    User Story 2: Store User-Defined Tags and Coordinate System in Project Metadata

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to define custom tags and specify a project-level coordinate system (e.g., EPSG code or WKT string) for my project, so I can better categorize and contextualize my work. This information should be saved in the project_meta.json file.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Extend ProjectMetadata Struct:

                In ProjectManager.h, add QStringList tags; and QString coordinateSystem; to the ProjectMetadata struct.

            Modify ProjectManager::saveProjectMetadataTransactional():

                When creating the QJsonObject from m_metadata, add new key-value pairs for "tags" (converting QStringList to QJsonArray of strings) and "coordinateSystem" (as a QString).

            Modify ProjectManager::loadProjectMetadataWithValidation():

                When parsing the QJsonObject into m_metadata, read the "tags" QJsonArray (converting back to QStringList) and the "coordinateSystem" QString. Handle cases where these fields might be missing in older project_meta.json files (i.e., load them as empty/default).

            Update ProjectMetadata::isValid() (Optional): Decide if these new fields are mandatory for a project to be considered "valid" by this method. For now, assume they are optional.

            Placeholder UI (Conceptual - No GUI Implementation in this Sprint):

                Conceptually, CreateProjectDialog could have input fields for these.

                A future "Project Properties" dialog would allow editing these for existing projects.

                For this sprint, testing will involve manual JSON editing or setting these fields programmatically in tests.

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager.h: ProjectMetadata struct definition updated.

            ProjectManager.cpp: saveProjectMetadataTransactional() and loadProjectMetadataWithValidation() methods modified to handle tags and coordinateSystem.

            project_meta.json: Schema will now include optional tags (array of strings) and coordinateSystem (string) fields.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            The project_meta.json file schema is extended to optionally include a tags array and a coordinateSystem string.

            When ProjectManager saves project metadata, if tags or coordinateSystem are set in its internal ProjectMetadata object, they are written to project_meta.json.

            When ProjectManager loads a project, it correctly reads tags and coordinateSystem from project_meta.json if they exist, and populates the corresponding fields in its internal ProjectMetadata object.

            If these fields are missing from an older project_meta.json, loading proceeds without error, and the corresponding ProjectMetadata fields are empty/default.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Manually create a project_meta.json file for a new project, including a "tags" array (e.g., ["survey", "buildingA", "interior"]) and a "coordinateSystem" string (e.g., "EPSG:4326").

                Test Data: The manually created project_meta.json.

                Expected Result: Open this project in the application. Use a debugger or log output to verify that the ProjectManager's internal m_metadata object correctly contains the loaded tags and coordinate system string.

                Testing Tool: Manual project setup, Debugger, Application Logs.

            Test Case 2.2: Programmatically set tags and coordinate system, save, close, and reopen.

                Test Data: In a test environment, create a new project, programmatically set m_metadata.tags = {"testTag1", "testTag2"}; and m_metadata.coordinateSystem = "WGS84"; in ProjectManager, then call saveProject().

                Expected Result: Close the project (or reset ProjectManager). Reopen the project. Verify that the loaded m_metadata object contains the "testTag1", "testTag2" and "WGS84" values. Check the content of project_meta.json on disk.

                Testing Tool: Unit/Integration test code, File system inspection.

            Test Case 2.3: Open an older project (whose project_meta.json does not contain tags or coordinateSystem fields).

                Test Data: A project_meta.json file from a version before this feature.

                Expected Result: Project loads successfully. The tags list in ProjectManager's m_metadata is empty, and coordinateSystem string is empty or default. No errors occur.

                Testing Tool: Manual project setup, Debugger, Application Logs.

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    File 1: ScanFileHeaderParserLAS.h/.cpp (Potentially New)

        Purpose: Utility class to parse header information specifically from LAS files.

        Contents: Methods to open LAS files, read public header block, extract number of point records, and min/max X,Y,Z values. Error handling for LAS-specific header issues.

        Relationships: Used by ScanImportManager. Reads from .las files on the File System.

    File 2: ScanFileHeaderParserE57.h/.cpp (Potentially New)

        Purpose: Utility class to parse header/XML information specifically from E57 files.

        Contents: Methods to open E57 files, parse the XML section to find data3D and points nodes, extract point counts and cartesianBounds. Error handling for E57-specific XML/header issues.

        Relationships: Used by ScanImportManager. Reads from .e57 files on the File System.

    File 3: ScanImportManager.h/.cpp (Significantly Modified)

        Purpose: To manage the process of importing scan files into the project.

        Contents (Modifications): Calls to new header parser utilities. Logic to populate ScanInfo with actual point counts and bounding boxes.

        Relationships: Interacts with header parsers, SQLiteManager, and ProjectManager.

    File 4: ProjectManager.h/.cpp (Modified)

        Purpose: To manage overall project lifecycle, metadata, and structure.

        Contents (Modifications): ProjectMetadata struct extended for tags and coordinateSystem. Save/load methods updated to handle these new JSON fields.

        Relationships: Reads/writes project_meta.json.

    File 5: SQLiteManager.h/.cpp (Minor Modification if any, primarily usage)

        Purpose: To handle all database interactions.

        Contents (Modifications): Ensure insertScan and updateScan can handle the now accurate point_count_estimate and bounding box data passed via ScanInfo. No schema changes to Scans table itself, as fields already exist.

        Relationships: Interacts with project_data.sqlite.

    File 6: project_meta.json (Schema Change)

        Purpose: Stores project-level metadata.

        Contents (Additions): Optional tags (array of strings) and coordinateSystem (string) fields.

        Relationships: Read/written by ProjectManager.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 4.1 Overall)

    Accurate point counts and bounding boxes are extracted from imported .las and .e57 scan file headers and stored in the project's SQLite database.

    The project_meta.json file can now store and retrieve user-defined project tags and a project-level coordinate system string.

    The scan import process remains efficient, with header parsing introducing minimal overhead.

    The application handles errors gracefully if scan file headers are unparsable for the required metadata.

    Loading older projects (without the new tags or coordinateSystem fields in their project_meta.json) works without errors.

7. Testing Plan (Sprint 4.1 Overall)

    Unit Tests:

        ScanFileHeaderParserLAS: Test with various LAS files (different versions, PDRFs, valid/corrupt headers). Verify correct extraction of point count and bounding box.

        ScanFileHeaderParserE57: Test with various E57 files (single/multiple scans, valid/malformed XML). Verify correct extraction.

        ScanImportManager: Mock header parsers. Test that ScanInfo is correctly populated and passed to SQLiteManager.

        ProjectManager: Test saving and loading of project_meta.json with and without tags and coordinateSystem fields.

    Integration Tests:

        Full import process for LAS files: Select file -> Header parsed -> ScanInfo populated -> Data saved to SQLite. Verify database contents.

        Full import process for E57 files: Similar to LAS.

        Project lifecycle: Create project -> (Programmatically set tags/coord_sys) -> Save -> Close -> Reopen -> Verify loaded metadata.

    Manual UI Tests: (Primarily focused on verifying data persistence, as UI for editing tags/coord_sys is out of scope for this sprint)

        Import various scan files and use an SQLite browser to check Scans table for accurate point counts and bounding boxes.

        Manually edit a project_meta.json to include tags and coordinate system. Open project and verify through logs or debugger that these are loaded by ProjectManager.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Functionalities from Sprints up to 3.3 are stable.

        Selected libraries (libLAS/LASlib, libE57Format) are suitable for efficient header-only reading or provide mechanisms to get this metadata without full point cloud loading.

        Standard LAS and E57 file formats are generally well-formed for header/XML metadata.

    Dependencies:

        External libraries for LAS and E57 parsing (e.g., libLAS, libE57Format, or internal parsing utilities if developed).

        Qt Core, Qt GUI, Qt SQL modules.

        SQLite library.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance: Header parsing during scan import should be fast (e.g., < 1 second per file for typical files, ideally much less). It should not significantly slow down the batch import of many scans.

    Accuracy: Extracted point counts and bounding boxes must be accurate as per the file's header information.

    Robustness: Graceful handling of files with missing or corrupt header information for these specific metadata fields. The system should not crash and should ideally still import the scan with default/null metadata values and log a warning.

    Data Integrity: Correct storage of extracted and user-defined metadata in SQLite and JSON files.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 4.1 focuses on enriching the data associated with scans and projects. By automatically extracting key metadata from scan files and allowing users to define additional project context, the application will become more informative and better prepared for advanced data processing and registration tasks. The emphasis on efficient header parsing ensures these enhancements do not negatively impact the user experience during scan import.
