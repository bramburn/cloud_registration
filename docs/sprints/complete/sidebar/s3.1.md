Sprint 3.1 Backlog: Robust Data Persistence & Error Handling
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 3.1 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. With foundational features for project setup, scan import, cluster organization, and basic data management in place from Sprints 1.1 through 2.3, this sprint is dedicated to ensuring the robustness and reliability of data persistence. Key goals include guaranteeing that all project settings, the complete hierarchical structure, and the states of scans and clusters are accurately saved to and loaded from their respective .json and .sqlite files. Furthermore, this sprint will address critical error handling, particularly for missing linked scan files and scenarios involving corrupted project data files.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Reliable Saving of Full Project State

        Description: As a user, when I save my project, I want all aspects of its current state—including general project information, the complete cluster and scan hierarchy, scan metadata (paths, import types), and cluster states (e.g., locked/unlocked)—to be accurately and completely persisted to disk, so that I can confidently close and later reopen my project without loss of work or structural integrity.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a comprehensive "Save Project" function in ProjectManager.

            This function must ensure that the latest project-level metadata (e.g., name, description from project_meta.json if modified in session) is written to the project_meta.json file.

            Ensure all scan metadata (including scan_name, file_path_project_relative, file_path_absolute_linked, import_type, point_count_estimate, bounding_box_min/max_x/y/z, scan_file_last_modified, parent_cluster_id) is accurately saved to the Scans table in project_data.sqlite.

            Ensure all cluster metadata (including cluster_name, parent_cluster_id, is_locked) is accurately saved to the Clusters table in project_data.sqlite.

            Verify that hierarchical relationships (scan membership in clusters, cluster parent-child links) are correctly represented and saved in the SQLite database.

            Implement transactional saving for SQLite operations to ensure atomicity and prevent partial saves in case of errors.

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager -> SQLiteManager (for all DML operations on Scans and Clusters tables).

            ProjectManager -> File System (for writing project_meta.json).

            project_meta.json (written to).

            project_data.sqlite (written to).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Invoking "Save Project" successfully writes all current project information from memory to project_meta.json.

            All scan metadata, cluster metadata, and their hierarchical relationships are correctly and completely saved to the project_data.sqlite database.

            The last_modified_date in project_meta.json is updated upon saving.

            SQLite database saves are transactional; in case of an error during save, the database remains in its previous consistent state.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Create a new project, add scans (all import types), create a complex cluster hierarchy, move scans, lock some clusters. Save project. Verify project_meta.json and project_data.sqlite contents against the in-application state using an SQLite browser and text editor.

            Test Case 1.2: Modify an existing project (e.g., rename a cluster, move a scan, unlock a cluster). Save project. Verify changes are reflected in the persisted files.

            Test Case 1.3: Test saving a large project (many scans/clusters) to ensure performance is acceptable and no data is lost.

    User Story 2: Reliable Loading of Full Project State

        Description: As a user, when I open an existing project, I want the application to accurately load and reconstruct the entire project state—including general project information, the complete cluster and scan hierarchy, all scan metadata, and cluster states—from the persisted files, so that the project appears exactly as I last saved it.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a comprehensive "Load Project" function in ProjectManager (enhancement of existing open functionality).

            This function must read and parse project_meta.json to get top-level project information.

            Connect to project_data.sqlite and query the Clusters and Scans tables.

            Reconstruct the entire cluster hierarchy in the ProjectTreeModel based on parent_cluster_id fields in Clusters and Scans tables.

            Populate all scan metadata for each scan item in the model from the Scans table.

            Set the lock state for each cluster item in the model based on the is_locked field from the Clusters table.

            Ensure the SidebarView correctly displays the fully reconstructed hierarchy and states.

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager -> SQLiteManager (for querying Scans and Clusters tables).

            ProjectManager -> File System (for reading project_meta.json).

            ProjectManager -> ProjectTreeModel (to populate with loaded data).

            project_meta.json (read from).

            project_data.sqlite (read from).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Opening a previously saved project correctly loads all information from project_meta.json.

            The full cluster and scan hierarchy is accurately reconstructed in the sidebar based on data from project_data.sqlite.

            All scan metadata (name, path, import type etc.) is correctly associated with scan items in the sidebar.

            Lock states for clusters are correctly restored and visually indicated in the sidebar.

            The application state (sidebar, etc.) matches the state of the project when it was last saved.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Save a project with a complex structure (nested clusters, scans of all import types, some locked clusters). Close and reopen the project. Verify the sidebar, scan details (e.g., in tooltips or a temporary properties panel), and cluster lock states are identical to the saved state.

            Test Case 2.2: Verify that opening a project created with the current version loads correctly.

    User Story 3: Error Handling for Missing Linked Scan Files

        Description: As a user, if I open a project that contains scans imported via "Link to Source" and the original source files have been moved, renamed, or deleted, I want the application to gracefully handle this by clearly indicating the missing files in the sidebar and providing an option to attempt to re-link them or remove the reference, rather than crashing or failing to load the project.

        Actions to Undertake:

            During project load, or when attempting to load/view a "LINKED" scan, check if the absolute path stored in Scans.file_path_absolute_linked is accessible and points to a valid file.

            If a linked file is missing or inaccessible:

                Display a clear visual indicator in the SidebarView for that scan item (e.g., a warning icon, red text, strikethrough).

                Prevent actions that require the file data (e.g., "Load Scan", "View Point Cloud") for that specific scan, or disable them.

                Provide an option in the scan's context menu like "Relink Scan File..." which opens a file dialog for the user to locate the moved file. If re-linked successfully, update the file_path_absolute_linked in SQLite.

                Provide an option "Remove Missing Scan Reference" which removes the scan entry from the project (after confirmation).

            The project should still load successfully even if some linked scans are missing.

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager (on attempting to access linked scan) -> File System (to check file existence).

            ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager -> ProjectTreeModel (to update visual state of missing scan).

            SidebarView (context menu for relink/remove) -> ProjectManager / ScanManager.

            ProjectManager / ScanManager -> SQLiteManager (to update path or delete scan record).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Project loads successfully even if some "LINKED" scan files are not found at their stored absolute paths.

            Missing linked scans are clearly marked with a visual warning in the sidebar.

            Attempting to load/view a missing linked scan results in a user-friendly message, not a crash.

            Context menu for a missing linked scan offers "Relink Scan File..." and "Remove Missing Scan Reference".

            "Relink Scan File..." allows user to select a new path; if valid, the path is updated in SQLite and the warning indicator is removed.

            "Remove Missing Scan Reference" (after confirmation) removes the scan from the sidebar and SQLite.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Create a project, import a scan using "Link to Source". Save and close. Move the original source file. Reopen project. Verify warning indicator on the scan, and that load/view actions are disabled or show an error.

            Test Case 3.2: For a missing linked scan, use "Relink Scan File..." to point to the new location. Verify the scan can now be loaded and the warning is gone. Path in SQLite is updated.

            Test Case 3.3: For a missing linked scan, use "Remove Missing Scan Reference". Verify scan is removed from UI and SQLite.

            Test Case 3.4: Project with multiple linked scans, some missing, some present. Verify project loads, present scans are normal, missing ones are marked.

    User Story 4: Basic Error Handling for Corrupted Project Files

        Description: As a user, if I attempt to open a project where the project_meta.json or project_data.sqlite file is significantly corrupted or unreadable, I want the application to display a user-friendly error message indicating the problem and prevent the project from loading incorrectly, rather than crashing.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement try-catch blocks or other error checking mechanisms around the parsing of project_meta.json.

            Implement error checking for SQLite database connection and critical queries (e.g., reading Clusters and Scans tables).

            If project_meta.json parsing fails (e.g., invalid JSON format), display an error message like "Project metadata file (project_meta.json) is corrupted or unreadable. Cannot open project."

            If SQLite database connection fails or essential tables are missing/corrupt, display an error message like "Project database (project_data.sqlite) is corrupted or inaccessible. Cannot open project."

            In such cases, the application should return to the Project Hub or a safe state.

            (Optional Stretch Goal) Consider implementing a basic backup/recovery mechanism (e.g., automatically creating *.bak files on save).

        References between Files:

            ProjectManager (during project load) -> File System (reading project_meta.json).

            ProjectManager (during project load) -> SQLiteManager (connecting to and querying project_data.sqlite).

        Acceptance Criteria:

            If project_meta.json is malformed or unreadable, the application shows a clear error message and does not attempt to load the project further.

            If project_data.sqlite is missing, cannot be opened, or essential tables are missing/corrupt, the application shows a clear error message and does not load the project.

            The application does not crash in these scenarios but returns to a stable state (e.g., Project Hub).

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 4.1: Manually corrupt project_meta.json (e.g., delete a curly brace). Attempt to open the project. Verify specific error message and no crash.

            Test Case 4.2: Delete project_data.sqlite from a valid project folder. Attempt to open the project. Verify specific error message.

            Test Case 4.3: Manually corrupt project_data.sqlite (e.g., open in text editor and alter binary content, or delete a critical table using an SQLite browser). Attempt to open. Verify specific error message.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 3.1 Overall)

    Refine Save/Load Logic: Thoroughly review and enhance ProjectManager to ensure all data points from User Stories 1 & 2 are covered during save and load operations. Pay close attention to the interaction between .json and .sqlite.

    Implement File Accessibility Checks: Add logic to check for linked file existence during load and before attempting operations on them.

    UI for Error States: Design and implement visual indicators for missing linked scans in the SidebarView (potentially using a custom delegate). Design user-friendly error dialogs.

    Context Menu Additions: Implement "Relink Scan File..." and "Remove Missing Scan Reference" options.

    Robust Error Trapping: Add comprehensive error handling (try-catch, status checks) for file I/O and database operations.

    Testing Strategy: Develop a suite of test projects with various states (linked files, copied files, moved files, complex hierarchies, locked clusters) to be used for validating save/load persistence. Create intentionally corrupted project files for error handling tests.

4. References between Files

    ProjectManager <-> project_meta.json (R/W for project-level info)

    ProjectManager <-> SQLiteManager (R/W for all hierarchical data, scan metadata, cluster states)

    SQLiteManager <-> project_data.sqlite

    ProjectManager / PointCloudLoadManager <-> File System (to verify existence of linked scan files)

    ProjectTreeModel <-> ProjectManager (for populating model on load, and signaling UI updates for missing files)

    SidebarView / SidebarItemDelegate (for displaying error states of scan items)

5. List of Files being Created (or significantly modified)

    No new persistent file types are introduced in this sprint. The focus is on the reliability of reading/writing existing project_meta.json and project_data.sqlite.

    Code Files (Illustrative, additions/modifications):

        ProjectManager.h/.cpp (Significantly Modified): Major enhancements to save and load logic to cover all project aspects. Added logic for checking linked file accessibility and handling corrupted project files.

        SQLiteManager.h/.cpp (Modified): Ensure all queries for loading full project state are robust. Add queries for updating linked file paths.

        ProjectTreeModel.h/.cpp (Modified): Add data roles and logic to support visual indication of missing/inaccessible linked scans. Handle relink/remove actions.

        SidebarWidget.h/.cpp (Modified): Context menus updated for relink/remove actions for missing scans.

        ErrorDialog.h/.cpp (Potentially New): A reusable dialog for displaying user-friendly error messages.

        RelinkFileDialog.h/.cpp (Potentially New): Dialog to allow user to browse for a new location of a missing linked scan file.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 3.1 Overall)

    All project data (JSON metadata, SQLite structure including scan details and cluster states) is reliably saved when the user saves the project.

    Opening a project accurately restores its complete state, including hierarchy, scan details, and cluster lock states, as it was last saved.

    The application gracefully handles missing "LINKED" scan files by visually indicating them in the sidebar and providing options to relink or remove the reference.

    The application displays user-friendly error messages and does not crash if project_meta.json or project_data.sqlite are corrupted or unreadable.

    Thorough testing of various project configurations (different import types, nested structures, locked states) confirms data persistence and robustness.

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        ProjectManager: Test save logic for complex project structures (verify mock JSON and mock SQLite calls). Test load logic (mock JSON/SQLite data, verify model population). Test detection and handling of missing linked files (mock file system). Test handling of corrupted file scenarios (mock file read failures).

        SQLiteManager: Test complex queries for loading entire project hierarchies.

    Integration Tests:

        Save/Load Cycle Test: Create a project with diverse elements (copied, moved, linked scans; nested and locked clusters). Save. Close. Reopen. Verify 100% state restoration. Repeat with modifications.

        Missing Linked File Test: Create a project with linked scans. Manually move/delete a source file. Reopen project. Verify error indication and relink/remove functionality.

        Corrupted File Test: Manually corrupt project_meta.json. Attempt to open. Verify error. Manually corrupt project_data.sqlite. Attempt to open. Verify error.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S3.1.1: Full Project Save and Load Integrity.

            Test Data: Create a project. Import scans (1 copied, 1 moved, 1 linked). Create 3 levels of nested clusters. Move scans between clusters. Lock one cluster. Save.

            Expected Result: Close and reopen. The entire structure, scan locations, import types, and lock state are identical to before closing. Linked scan is accessible.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser, File Explorer.

        Test Case S3.1.2: Handle Missing Linked Scan on Load.

            Test Data: Project from S3.1.1. Before reopening, delete the original file of the "linked" scan.

            Expected Result: Project opens. Linked scan shows a warning icon/style. Attempting to "Load Scan" on it shows an error. Context menu offers "Relink" and "Remove".

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.1.3: Relink Missing Scan.

            Test Data: Project from S3.1.2. Restore the deleted linked file to a new location. Use "Relink Scan File..."

            Expected Result: User can browse to the new location. Path updates in SQLite. Warning icon disappears. Scan can now be loaded.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S3.1.4: Remove Missing Scan Reference.

            Test Data: Project from S3.1.2. Use "Remove Missing Scan Reference".

            Expected Result: Scan is removed from sidebar and SQLite. Confirmation dialog shown.

            Testing Tool: Manual, SQLite Browser.

        Test Case S3.1.5: Open Project with Corrupted project_meta.json.

            Test Data: Valid project. Manually edit project_meta.json to make it invalid (e.g., remove a brace).

            Expected Result: Application shows a clear error message about corrupted metadata and returns to Project Hub. No crash.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

        Test Case S3.1.6: Open Project with Corrupted project_data.sqlite.

            Test Data: Valid project. Manually corrupt project_data.sqlite (e.g., rename it, or use hex editor to change bytes).

            Expected Result: Application shows a clear error message about corrupted database and returns to Project Hub. No crash.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        All functionalities from Sprints up to 2.3 (project management, all import types, cluster organization, load/unload, locking, context menus) are completed and stable.

        Session state for "loaded/unloaded" scans is managed in memory and does not need to be persisted across application sessions (i.e., all scans are considered "unloaded" when a project is first opened). If persistence of loaded state is required, this is a scope change.

    Dependencies:

        GUI Framework (e.g., Qt 6) for dialogs, error messages, sidebar updates.

        SQLite library for robust database transactions and error handling.

        JSON library for parsing and error detection.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Reliability:

        Save operations must be atomic (all or nothing, especially for SQLite). No partial saves that corrupt the project.

        Project loading must be resilient to common issues like missing linked files.

        Application must not crash due to corrupted project files.

    Performance:

        Saving a project with moderate complexity (e.g., 50 scans, 20 clusters) should complete within a few seconds.

        Loading such a project should also be within a few seconds.

    Data Integrity:

        No data loss should occur during normal save/load operations.

        Relationships (hierarchy, scan membership, linked paths) must be maintained accurately.

    User Experience:

        Error messages related to data persistence or file issues must be clear, understandable, and guide the user if possible (e.g., "File not found at [path]. Would you like to locate it?").

10. Conclusion

Sprint 3.1 is a crucial consolidation phase focused on making the application's data handling robust and reliable. Ensuring that users can confidently save and load their complex project structures without data loss or corruption is paramount. The graceful handling of common issues like missing linked files will significantly improve the user experience and prevent frustration. Successful completion of this sprint will build trust in the application's stability and pave the way for implementing more complex data processing features like point cloud viewing and registration.
