Sprint 4.3 Backlog: UI for Memory Stats & Basic LOD Controls
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 4.3 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. This sprint follows Sprint 4.2 (SQLite Schema for Registration & Basic Matrix Storage) and is part of "Phase 4: Core Data Enhancement & Initial Registration Prep." The primary focus of Sprint 4.3 is to enhance user awareness and control over application performance by implementing a UI display for live memory usage of loaded point clouds and introducing a basic Level of Detail (LOD) toggle/control within the point cloud viewer. These features aim to provide users with initial tools to manage resource consumption and improve rendering performance for large datasets.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Display Live Memory Usage in UI

        Description: As a user, I want to see a display in the application's UI (e.g., status bar) that shows an estimate of the current memory being used by loaded point cloud data, so I can monitor resource consumption.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Enhance PointCloudLoadManager Memory Tracking:

                Ensure PointCloudLoadManager accurately calculates and maintains the total memory footprint of all currently loaded point cloud data. This calculation should consider the number of points and the size of each point's attributes (XYZ, color, intensity if loaded).

                Implement a method in PointCloudLoadManager to retrieve the current total memory usage (e.g., getCurrentMemoryUsageInBytes()).

                Emit a signal (e.g., memoryUsageChanged(quint64 currentBytes)) from PointCloudLoadManager whenever scans/clusters are loaded or unloaded, causing a change in total memory usage.

            Implement UI Element in MainWindow:

                In MainWindow::setupStatusBar(), add a new QLabel (e.g., m_memoryUsageLabel) specifically for displaying memory usage.

                Style this label for clear visibility.

            Connect PointCloudLoadManager Signal to MainWindow UI:

                In MainWindow, create a slot (e.g., updateMemoryUsageDisplay(quint64 currentBytes)) that takes the memory usage in bytes.

                This slot will format the byte value into a user-friendly string (e.g., "Memory Used: 123.4 MB" or "Memory Used: 1.2 GB").

                Connect the PointCloudLoadManager::memoryUsageChanged signal to this MainWindow::updateMemoryUsageDisplay slot.

            Initial Display and Updates:

                Ensure the memory usage display is initialized to "0 MB" or an appropriate starting value when no project or data is loaded.

                Verify the display updates dynamically upon loading and unloading scans/clusters.

        References between Files:

            PointCloudLoadManager.h/.cpp: Will contain the core logic for memory tracking (calculating size of m_scanStates data) and emitting memoryUsageChanged signal.

            MainWindow.h/.cpp: Will instantiate m_memoryUsageLabel, connect to PointCloudLoadManager's signal, and implement the slot to update the label's text.

            ProjectManager.cpp (indirectly): When scans are loaded/unloaded via ProjectManager interacting with PointCloudLoadManager, this will trigger memory updates.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A dedicated label or section in the MainWindow's status bar (or another clearly visible UI area) displays the estimated current memory usage of loaded point clouds.

            The displayed memory value updates automatically and correctly when individual scans are loaded into memory.

            The displayed memory value updates automatically and correctly when all scans in a cluster are loaded.

            The displayed memory value updates automatically and correctly (decreases or resets) when individual scans or all scans in a cluster are unloaded from memory.

            Memory usage is displayed in a human-readable format (e.g., "XX.X MB" or "X.XX GB").

            The display is initialized to an appropriate value (e.g., "0 MB") when the application starts or no data is loaded.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 1.1: Application Start and No Project Loaded.

                Test Data: N/A.

                Expected Result: Memory usage display in the status bar shows "0 MB" or a minimal baseline.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI inspection.

            Test Case 1.2: Load a Single Scan.

                Test Data: A scan file with a known number of points and attributes.

                Expected Result: After the scan is loaded, the memory usage display updates to a value consistent with the scan's data size (e.g., num_points * bytes_per_point).

                Testing Tool: Manual UI inspection, debugger to check PointCloudLoadManager's internal tracking.

            Test Case 1.3: Load Multiple Scans.

                Test Data: Import and load two or more scans.

                Expected Result: The memory usage display updates to reflect the cumulative size of all loaded scans.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI inspection.

            Test Case 1.4: Unload a Scan.

                Test Data: Load a scan, then unload it.

                Expected Result: The memory usage display decreases by the appropriate amount corresponding to the unloaded scan.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI inspection.

            Test Case 1.5: Unload All Scans / Close Project.

                Test Data: Load several scans, then unload all or close the project.

                Expected Result: The memory usage display returns to "0 MB" or the baseline.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI inspection.

            Test Case 1.6: Load/Unload Cluster.

                Test Data: A cluster containing multiple scans.

                Expected Result: Memory display updates correctly when "Load All Scans in Cluster" and "Unload All Scans in Cluster" actions are used.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI inspection.

    User Story 2: Implement Basic LOD Toggle/Control in Viewer

        Description: As a user, I want a simple way to toggle a basic Level of Detail (LOD) or adjust point cloud density in the viewer (e.g., via a debug menu or a simple slider), so I can improve rendering performance for large clouds.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement Subsampling Logic:

                In PointCloudLoadManager or PointCloudViewerWidget, implement a basic subsampling algorithm. A simple random subsampling (e.g., keep X% of points) is sufficient for this prototype.

                Method signature could be: std::vector<float> getSubsampledPoints(const std::vector<float>& fullPoints, float subsamplingRatio).

            Add LOD State Management to PointCloudViewerWidget:

                Add a boolean member m_isLodActive and a float m_lodSubsamplingRatio (e.g., default 0.5 for 50%).

                Modify PointCloudViewerWidget::loadPointCloud():

                    Store the full point data.

                    If m_isLodActive, generate and also store/use the subsampled version for rendering.

            Implement UI Control for LOD:

                Add a simple UI control in MainWindow (e.g., a checkbox in a "View" or "Debug" menu labeled "Enable Basic LOD (50% Points)").

                Alternatively, a slider in a settings panel associated with the viewer could control m_lodSubsamplingRatio (e.g., from 0.1 to 1.0). For this sprint, a simple toggle is sufficient.

            Connect UI Control to Viewer Logic:

                When the LOD UI control is changed, call a new public slot in PointCloudViewerWidget (e.g., setLodActive(bool active, float ratio = 0.5f)).

                This slot will update m_isLodActive and m_lodSubsamplingRatio. It will then need to either re-process the currently loaded full point data to generate the new LOD version or request it from PointCloudLoadManager.

                Trigger a repaint of the PointCloudViewerWidget to reflect the change in density.

            Modify Rendering Logic:

                In PointCloudViewerWidget::paintGL(), check m_isLodActive. If true, bind and draw the subsampled vertex buffer; otherwise, draw the full vertex buffer.

        References between Files:

            PointCloudViewerWidget.h/.cpp: Will contain the LOD state variables (m_isLodActive, m_lodSubsamplingRatio), the slot setLodActive(), modifications to loadPointCloud() to handle LOD data, and paintGL() to render either full or LOD data. May contain the subsampling algorithm itself.

            PointCloudLoadManager.h/.cpp: Potentially, if subsampling is done here before passing data to the viewer.

            MainWindow.h/.cpp: Will contain the UI control (e.g., menu action, checkbox) for toggling LOD and will call PointCloudViewerWidget::setLodActive().

        Acceptance Criteria:

            A UI control (e.g., a menu checkbox) allows the user to toggle a basic LOD mode.

            When LOD mode is activated (e.g., set to 50% subsampling), the point cloud displayed in the PointCloudViewerWidget becomes visibly less dense.

            When LOD mode is deactivated, the viewer displays the full-resolution point cloud data.

            The switch between LOD and full display is reasonably quick for moderately sized point clouds.

            (Informal) A noticeable improvement in rendering frame rate or responsiveness is observed when viewing a very large point cloud with LOD enabled compared to LOD disabled.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Load a Large Scan and Toggle LOD.

                Test Data: A scan file with several million points.

                Expected Result: Load the scan. Initially, full data is displayed. Enable "Basic LOD" via the UI control. The displayed point cloud density visibly decreases. Disable LOD. Full density is restored.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction, visual inspection.

            Test Case 2.2: Performance Observation with LOD.

                Test Data: A very large scan file that causes noticeable lag or low FPS with full rendering.

                Expected Result: With LOD enabled, camera navigation (orbit, pan, zoom) in the viewer feels more responsive, or a measurable increase in FPS is observed (if an FPS counter is available).

                Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction, visual assessment of responsiveness, (optional) FPS counter.

            Test Case 2.3: LOD State Persistence (Within Session).

                Test Data: Load scan A, enable LOD. Load scan B.

                Expected Result: Scan B should also initially display with LOD enabled if the LOD toggle is a global viewer setting. If it's per-dataset, then Scan B might load full and LOD needs re-enabling. (Clarify desired behavior - for this sprint, a global viewer setting is simpler).

                Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction.

            Test Case 2.4: Subsampling Ratio Effect (if slider implemented).

                Test Data: A scan file.

                Expected Result: Adjusting an LOD density slider changes the visible density of points in the viewer accordingly. Lower values result in sparser clouds.

                Testing Tool: Manual UI interaction.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 4.3 Overall)

    The application displays an estimated current memory usage for loaded point clouds in the status bar, updating correctly on load/unload.

    A basic LOD mechanism (e.g., random subsampling toggle) is available in the UI.

    Activating LOD visibly reduces point cloud density in the viewer and shows a perceptible performance improvement with large datasets.

    The application remains stable when using these new UI elements and LOD functionality.

7. Testing Plan (Sprint 4.3 Overall)

    Unit Tests:

        PointCloudLoadManager: Test memory calculation logic with mock scan data.

        PointCloudViewerWidget / Subsampling utility: Test the random subsampling algorithm to ensure it reduces point count by the expected ratio and doesn't introduce biases.

    Integration Tests:

        Load scan -> PointCloudLoadManager calculates memory -> Signal emitted -> MainWindow updates status bar label.

        Toggle LOD in MainWindow -> PointCloudViewerWidget slot called -> m_isLodActive updated -> paintGL renders appropriate data.

    Manual UI Tests: (As detailed in individual User Story testing plans)

        Verify memory display accuracy and updates.

        Verify LOD toggle changes visual density and improves responsiveness.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Sprints 4.1 and 4.2 are complete and stable.

        PointCloudLoadManager has a way to determine the data size of loaded scans (e.g., from std::vector::size() and sizeof(float)).

        A simple random subsampling is acceptable for the "basic LOD prototype."

        The performance difference with basic LOD will be noticeable enough on available test datasets.

    Dependencies:

        Qt Widgets (for QLabel, QCheckBox or QAction in menu, QSlider if used).

        Qt Core (for signals/slots, QTimer if any async updates).

        Existing PointCloudLoadManager and PointCloudViewerWidget architecture.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Performance (Memory Display): Updating the memory usage label should have negligible performance impact.

    Performance (LOD):

        Toggling LOD on/off should be reasonably fast (e.g., re-processing for LOD or switching buffers should not cause long freezes).

        Rendering with LOD enabled should demonstrably improve frame rates or camera responsiveness for large point clouds.

    Usability:

        Memory usage display should be clear and easy to understand.

        LOD toggle/control should be accessible and its effect immediately visible.

    Accuracy (Memory Display): The memory display should provide a reasonable estimate. Exact OS-level process memory is not required, but an estimate of point data in memory.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 4.3 introduces important user-facing feedback and control mechanisms related to application performance and resource management. The memory usage display will help users understand the impact of loading large datasets, while the basic LOD prototype will offer an initial way to improve interactivity when dealing with dense point clouds. These features enhance the application's usability and provide a stepping stone towards more sophisticated performance optimization techniques in the future.
