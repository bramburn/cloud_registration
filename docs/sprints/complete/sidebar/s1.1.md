Sprint 1.1 Backlog: Startup UI & Project Creation/Opening
1. Introduction

This document outlines the detailed backlog for Sprint 1.1 of the Cloud Registration Application Enhancement project. The primary goal of this sprint is to implement the initial application startup user interface (Project Hub) which will allow users to create new projects, open existing projects, and view a list of recently accessed projects. Additionally, a basic sidebar will be implemented to display the root of an opened project. This sprint lays the foundational framework for project management within the application.
2. User Stories

    User Story 1: Project Hub Display on Startup

        Description: As a new or returning user, when I launch the application, I want to be presented with a Project Hub screen so that I can easily choose to create a new project, open an existing one, or quickly access a recent project.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Design the layout for the Project Hub screen (mockups/wireframes).

            Implement the main window structure that hosts the Project Hub view as the initial view.

            Implement UI elements for "Create New Project," "Open Project," and a section for "Recent Projects."

        References between Files:

            main.cpp (or equivalent application entry point) will instantiate and show the Project Hub window/view.

            The Project Hub UI component will interact with a future RecentProjectsManager module.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Application launches and displays the Project Hub screen as the first view.

            Buttons/options for "Create New Project" and "Open Project" are visible and clearly labeled.

            A placeholder or an empty list for "Recent Projects" is visible.

        Testing Plan:

            Manual UI testing: Launch application, verify Project Hub screen appears.

            Verify all main action buttons/areas are present.

    User Story 2: Create New Project Functionality

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to create a new project from the Project Hub, specifying a project name and a local folder for its storage, so that a new project environment (folder and basic metadata file) is set up.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a dialog for "Create New Project" that prompts for:

                Project Name.

                Directory path for project storage.

            Implement logic to create a new folder at the specified path with the project name (or a subfolder named after the project).

            Implement logic to create a basic .json metadata file (e.g., project_meta.json) within the new project folder.

            The .json file should initially contain:

                projectID: A unique identifier (e.g., UUID).

                projectName: The name provided by the user.

                creationDate: Timestamp of creation.

                fileFormatVersion: Version number for the metadata format.

            After project creation, the application should open this new project and display its root in the basic sidebar.

            The newly created project should be added to the top of the "Recent Projects" list.

        References between Files:

            Project Hub UI will trigger the "Create New Project" dialog.

            ProjectManager module (to be created) will handle project creation logic (folder, JSON file).

            project_meta.json file will be created and populated.

            RecentProjectsManager will be updated.

            The main application window will transition to show the project view with the basic sidebar.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can click "Create New Project" on the Project Hub.

            A dialog appears asking for project name and storage location.

            Upon confirmation, a new folder is created at the specified location.

            A project_meta.json file is created inside the project folder with projectID, projectName, creationDate, and fileFormatVersion.

            The application transitions to the main project view, displaying the new project's root in the sidebar.

            The new project appears in the "Recent Projects" list on the Project Hub (if revisited).

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 2.1: Create a new project with valid name and new folder.

            Test Case 2.2: Attempt to create a project in a restricted/non-writable directory (expect error handling).

            Test Case 2.3: Verify contents of the created project_meta.json.

            Test Case 2.4: Verify project appears in recent projects list.

    User Story 3: Open Existing Project Functionality

        Description: As a user, I want to be able to open an existing project from the Project Hub by browsing to its folder, so that the application loads the project metadata and displays its structure.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement the "Open Project" button functionality on the Project Hub.

            This button should trigger a system file/folder dialog that allows the user to select a project folder.

            Implement logic to validate the selected folder (e.g., check for the presence of project_meta.json).

            If valid, parse the project_meta.json file to load project information.

            After successfully opening, the application should display the project root in the basic sidebar.

            The opened project should be added to/updated in the "Recent Projects" list.

        References between Files:

            Project Hub UI will trigger the "Open Project" file dialog.

            ProjectManager module will handle project loading and validation logic, including parsing project_meta.json.

            RecentProjectsManager will be updated.

            The main application window will transition to show the project view with the basic sidebar.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            User can click "Open Project" on the Project Hub.

            A folder selection dialog appears.

            User can select a valid project folder (containing project_meta.json).

            Application reads project_meta.json and loads project details.

            Application transitions to the main project view, displaying the project's root in the sidebar.

            The opened project appears in the "Recent Projects" list.

            Graceful error message if an invalid folder (not a project) is selected.

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 3.1: Open a valid existing project.

            Test Case 3.2: Attempt to open a folder that is not a valid project (no project_meta.json).

            Test Case 3.3: Attempt to open a project with a corrupted project_meta.json.

            Test Case 3.4: Verify project appears/updates in recent projects list.

    User Story 4: Recent Projects List Display and Interaction

        Description: As a user, I want to see a list of my recently opened projects on the Project Hub and be able to open them with a single click, so that I can quickly resume my work.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a UI component to display the list of recent projects (e.g., QListView or custom list).

            Implement a RecentProjectsManager module to:

                Store a list of paths to recently opened/created projects (e.g., in a local settings file or system registry).

                Limit the number of recent projects displayed (e.g., to 10).

                Load this list on application startup.

                Update this list when a project is created or opened.

            Populate the "Recent Projects" section of the Project Hub with data from RecentProjectsManager.

            Implement click functionality on a recent project item to open that project directly (similar to "Open Existing Project" but without the folder dialog).

        References between Files:

            Project Hub UI will display data from RecentProjectsManager.

            RecentProjectsManager will read/write to a persistent storage (e.g., settings.ini, OS-specific settings).

            Interaction will trigger project loading via ProjectManager.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            Project Hub displays a list of recent projects (if any exist).

            The list is ordered by most recently accessed.

            Clicking a project in the list successfully opens that project.

            Newly created/opened projects are added to the top of the list.

            The list does not exceed a predefined maximum number of entries (older entries are removed).

        Testing Plan:

            Test Case 4.1: Verify empty list on first launch.

            Test Case 4.2: Create/open several projects and verify they appear in the recent list in correct order.

            Test Case 4.3: Open a project from the recent list.

            Test Case 4.4: Verify list size limit is enforced.

    User Story 5: Basic Sidebar Project Root Display

        Description: As a user, once a project is created or opened, I want to see a basic sidebar that displays the root of the project (e.g., the project name), so that I have a visual confirmation that the project is loaded and a placeholder for future project structure.

        Actions to Undertake:

            Implement a basic sidebar UI component (e.g., QTreeView or similar).

            When a project is successfully created or opened, the main application view should include this sidebar.

            The sidebar should display a single root node representing the currently open project, labeled with the project name.

        References between Files:

            Main application window will host the sidebar UI.

            ProjectManager will provide the project name to the sidebar model after a project is loaded.

            A basic ProjectTreeModel (or equivalent) will be needed for the QTreeView.

        Acceptance Criteria:

            After creating or opening a project, a sidebar is visible in the main application window.

            The sidebar displays one item: the root of the project, labeled with the project's name.

        Testing Plan:

            Manual UI testing: Create a new project, verify sidebar shows project name.

            Manual UI testing: Open an existing project, verify sidebar shows project name.

3. Actions to Undertake (Sprint 1.1 Overall)

    UI Design: Finalize wireframes/mockups for the Project Hub screen and the initial main application window with the basic sidebar.

    Module Creation:

        ProjectHubView: UI component for the startup screen.

        CreateProjectDialog: UI component for new project creation.

        ProjectManager: Business logic for creating, opening, loading project metadata.

        RecentProjectsManager: Logic for managing the list of recent projects.

        SidebarView: Basic UI component for the project tree.

        ProjectTreeModel: Basic data model for the sidebar.

    Implementation: Develop the features outlined in the user stories.

5. List of Files being Created

    File 1: project_meta.json

        Purpose: To store essential metadata for a given project.

        Contents:

            projectID (string, UUID): Unique identifier for the project.

            projectName (string): User-defined name of the project.

            creationDate (string, ISO 8601 Timestamp): Date and time of project creation.

            fileFormatVersion (string, e.g., "1.0.0"): Version of this metadata file structure.

            (Future fields: description, coordinateSystem, geolocation, clientName, etc.)

        Relationships: Located in the root of each project folder. Read by ProjectManager on project open. Written by ProjectManager on project creation.

    File 2: RecentProjects.cfg (or OS-specific equivalent, e.g., registry entries)

        Purpose: To persist the list of recently opened project paths across application sessions.

        Contents: An ordered list of absolute paths to project folders.

        Relationships: Read and written by RecentProjectsManager. Typically stored in a user-specific application data directory.

    Code Files (Illustrative, actual names and structure may vary based on architecture, e.g., using C++/Qt):

        ProjectHubWidget.h/.cpp: UI for the startup screen.

        CreateProjectDialog.h/.cpp: Dialog for new project input.

        ProjectManager.h/.cpp: Logic for project operations.

        RecentProjectsManager.h/.cpp: Logic for recent projects list.

6. Acceptance Criteria (Sprint 1.1 Overall)

    Application successfully launches to the Project Hub screen.

    User can create a new project: a folder is created, and a valid project_meta.json file is generated within it. The new project opens and its root is displayed in the sidebar.

    User can open an existing valid project: project_meta.json is read, and the project root is displayed in the sidebar.

    A list of recent projects is maintained and displayed on the Project Hub, allowing users to open projects from this list.

    Basic error handling is in place for invalid project selections or file I/O issues during project creation/opening.

    The basic sidebar is present after a project is opened, showing the project name as the root item.

7. Testing Plan

    Unit Tests:

        ProjectManager: Test project creation logic (folder, JSON creation, content validation). Test project opening logic (JSON parsing, error handling for missing/corrupt JSON).

        RecentProjectsManager: Test adding projects, list ordering, list size enforcement, persistence (saving/loading the list).

    Integration Tests:

        Test the flow: Project Hub -> Create New Project -> Project Opens -> Sidebar shows root.

        Test the flow: Project Hub -> Open Existing Project -> Project Opens -> Sidebar shows root.

        Test the flow: Project Hub -> Open Recent Project -> Project Opens -> Sidebar shows root.

    Manual UI Tests:

        Test Case S1.1.1: Launch application.

            Test Data: N/A.

            Test Data: Create/open more than the max number of recent projects.

            Expected Result: List updates correctly, oldest entries are removed, list limit is respected. Opening from list works.

            Testing Tool: Manual.

8. Assumptions and Dependencies

    Assumptions:

        Users have permissions to read/write to the locations they choose for project storage.

        The underlying operating system provides standard file and folder dialogs.

        A UUID generation library is available if needed for projectID.

    Dependencies:

        JSON parsing library (e.g., QJson for Qt).

        GUI framework (e.g., Qt 6 for UI elements like QTreeView, dialogs).

        Development environment and build tools are set up.

9. Non-Functional Requirements

    Usability:

        The Project Hub should be intuitive and easy to navigate.

        Dialogs for project creation and opening should be clear and provide necessary feedback.

    Performance:

        Application startup should be reasonably fast (e.g., < 3-5 seconds to Project Hub).

        Project creation and opening of basic projects (with minimal metadata) should be quick (e.g., < 2 seconds).

        Recent projects list should load instantly.

    Reliability:

        Project creation should reliably create the folder and metadata file.

        Opening projects should reliably parse valid metadata.

        Recent projects list should persist correctly between sessions.

    Error Handling:

        Graceful error messages for scenarios like:

            Attempting to create a project in a non-writable location.

            Attempting to create a project with an already existing name in the same location (user should be prompted to overwrite or choose a new name).

            Selecting an invalid folder when opening a project.

            Corrupted project_meta.json file.

            Corrupted recent projects configuration.

10. Conclusion

Sprint 1.1 focuses on establishing the critical entry points for users to interact with projects. Successful completion will provide a functional Project Hub for creating, opening, and accessing recent projects, and will transition the user to a main application view with a basic sidebar ready for further development of project content display. This sprint is crucial for the subsequent sprints that will build upon this project management foundation.
