# Sprint 3: Algorithms Library Implementation Summary

## Overview
Sprint 3 has been successfully completed. The Algorithms library has been implemented as a self-contained static library containing the core registration algorithms (ICPRegistration, LeastSquaresAlignment, PointToPlaneICP).

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Algorithm Files Integration
- **ICPRegistration.h/cpp**: Core ICP algorithm with K-D tree implementation
- **LeastSquaresAlignment.h/cpp**: Horn's method with SVD using Eigen3
- **PointToPlaneICP.h/cpp**: Point-to-plane ICP variant with normal estimation
- All files remain in `src/algorithms/` directory with correct include statements

### ✅ 2. Updated CMake Configuration
**File: `src/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt`**
- Defines `Algorithms` static library with all source files
- Links against required dependencies: Core, Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui, Eigen3::Eigen
- Proper include directories for modular structure
- Removed conditional Eigen3 linking (now required)

### ✅ 3. Test Migration and Configuration
**Moved test files:**
- `tests/test_icp_registration.cpp` → `tests/algorithms/test_icp_registration.cpp`
- `tests/sprint4/test_least_squares_alignment.cpp` → `tests/algorithms/test_least_squares_alignment.cpp`
- `tests/test_point_to_plane_icp.cpp` → `tests/algorithms/test_point_to_plane_icp.cpp`

**Updated include paths in test files:**
- Changed from `../src/algorithms/` to `../../src/algorithms/`
- All test files now correctly reference the algorithm headers

### ✅ 4. Test CMake Configuration
**File: `tests/algorithms/CMakeLists.txt`**
- Created three test executables:
  - `ICPRegistrationTests`
  - `LeastSquaresAlignmentTests`
  - `PointToPlaneICPTests`
- Each test links against: Algorithms, Core, GTest::gtest_main, Qt6::Test, Qt6::Core, Qt6::Gui
- LeastSquaresAlignmentTests also links against Eigen3::Eigen
- Proper include directories for accessing algorithm and core headers

### ✅ 5. Application Integration
**File: `src/app/CMakeLists.txt`**
- Already correctly configured to link against Algorithms library
- Does not directly compile algorithm source files
- Maintains proper separation between application and library code

### ✅ 6. Root Test Configuration
**File: `tests/CMakeLists.txt`**
- Already includes algorithms subdirectory
- ALL_TESTS list already contains the correct test executable names:
  - `ICPRegistrationTests`
  - `LeastSquaresAlignmentTests`
  - `PointToPlaneICPTests`

## Validation Results
All validation checks passed:
- ✅ Algorithm source files properly located
- ✅ CMake configuration correct with all dependencies
- ✅ Test files successfully migrated
- ✅ Old test files removed from original locations
- ✅ Test CMake configuration complete
- ✅ Include paths updated correctly
- ✅ App CMakeLists.txt properly configured

## Dependencies
The Algorithms library has the following dependencies:
- **Core**: For foundational data structures and utilities
- **Qt6::Core**: Basic Qt functionality
- **Qt6::Gui**: For QVector3D, QMatrix4x4 geometric operations
- **Eigen3::Eigen**: Required for SVD operations in LeastSquaresAlignment

## Testing
Three comprehensive test suites are now available:
1. **ICPRegistrationTests**: Tests point-to-point ICP functionality, K-D tree operations, convergence, and integration with AlignmentEngine
2. **LeastSquaresAlignmentTests**: Tests Horn's method implementation, SVD computation, edge cases, and numerical stability
3. **PointToPlaneICPTests**: Tests point-to-plane ICP variant, normal estimation, and performance characteristics

## Build Instructions
To build the Algorithms library specifically:
```bash
cmake --build build --target Algorithms
```

To build and run algorithm tests:
```bash
cmake --build build --target ICPRegistrationTests
cmake --build build --target LeastSquaresAlignmentTests
cmake --build build --target PointToPlaneICPTests
ctest -R "ICPRegistrationTests|LeastSquaresAlignmentTests|PointToPlaneICPTests"
```

## Next Steps
With Sprint 3 complete, the following sprints can now proceed in parallel:
- **Sprint 4**: Parsers Library (E57, LAS parsers)
- **Sprint 5**: Rendering Library (OpenGL, camera control)
- **Sprint 6**: UI Library (reusable widgets)

The Algorithms library provides a stable foundation for other modules that require registration and alignment functionality.
