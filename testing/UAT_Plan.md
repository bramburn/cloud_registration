# User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Plan
# Cloud Registration MVP

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Testing Phase:** Sprint 8 - Final Validation  

## Overview

This document provides detailed user acceptance testing scenarios for the Cloud Registration MVP. These tests are designed to be executed by non-developer users to validate that the application meets real-world usage requirements.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 or Ubuntu 20.04+ or macOS 10.15+
- 8GB RAM minimum, 16GB recommended
- OpenGL 3.3+ compatible graphics card
- 2GB free disk space

### Test Environment Setup
1. Install Cloud Registration application using provided installer
2. Ensure sample datasets are available in the application directory
3. Verify all dependencies are properly installed
4. Have a text editor available for recording test results

### Test Data Location
- Sample datasets should be located in: `[Application Directory]/sample/`
- Required files:
  - `bunnyDouble.e57` - Primary test scan
  - `bunnyInt32.e57` - Secondary test scan

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Surveyor Workflow - E57 Registration

**Objective:** Validate complete registration workflow using E57 scan data  
**User Role:** Professional Surveyor  
**Expected Duration:** 30-45 minutes  
**Success Criteria:** Complete registration with RMS error < 2.0mm  

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Application Launch**
1. Launch Cloud Registration application from Start Menu (Windows) or Applications folder (macOS/Linux)
2. Verify application opens without errors
3. Confirm main interface displays properly

**Expected Result:** Application launches successfully with main window visible

**Step 2: Create New Project**
1. Click "New Project" button or use File → New Project
2. Enter project name: "UAT_E57_Registration_Test"
3. Choose project location (use Desktop or Documents folder)
4. Add project description: "User acceptance test for E57 registration"
5. Click "Create Project"

**Expected Result:** New project created successfully, project hub displays

**Step 3: Import First Scan**
1. Click "Import Scan" or use File → Import → Point Cloud
2. Navigate to sample data directory
3. Select `bunnyDouble.e57`
4. Configure import settings (use default values)
5. Click "Import"
6. Wait for import to complete

**Expected Result:** 
- Import progress bar displays
- Scan loads successfully
- Point cloud displays in 3D viewer
- Scan appears in project tree

**Step 4: Import Second Scan**
1. Repeat import process for `bunnyInt32.e57`
2. Verify both scans appear in project tree
3. Test switching between scans in viewer

**Expected Result:** 
- Second scan imports successfully
- Both scans visible in project hierarchy
- Can switch between scan views

| Step | Status | Notes | Issues |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1. Application Launch | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail | | |
| 2. Create Project | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail | | |
| 3. Import Scan 1 | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail | | |
| 4. Import Scan 2 | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail | | |

**Overall Test Result:** ☐ Pass ☐ Fail

### Scenario 2: GIS Specialist Workflow - Data Export

**Objective:** Validate data export and file format handling  
**User Role:** GIS Specialist  
**Expected Duration:** 20-30 minutes  
**Success Criteria:** Successful export in multiple formats  

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Load Previous Results**
1. Open Cloud Registration application
2. Load the project created in Scenario 1: "UAT_E57_Registration_Test"
3. Verify point cloud data is available

**Expected Result:** Previous project loads with point cloud data

**Step 2: Export to E57 Format**
1. Select point cloud in project tree
2. Access export functionality
3. Select E57 format
4. Set filename: "UAT_Export_Result.e57"
5. Execute export

**Expected Result:**
- Export completes successfully
- File created at specified location
- File size is reasonable (not empty, not corrupted)

#### Test Results Recording

| Step | Status | Notes | Issues |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| 1. Load Project | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail | | |
| 2. Export E57 | ☐ Pass ☐ Fail | | |

**Overall Test Result:** ☐ Pass ☐ Fail

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check system requirements
- Try running as administrator (Windows)
- Check application logs for error messages

### Import Failures
- Verify file format is supported (E57, LAS)
- Check file is not corrupted
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try with smaller test files first

### Performance Issues
- Close other applications to free memory
- Reduce point cloud density if possible
- Check graphics driver updates
- Monitor system resources during operation

## Test Completion Checklist
