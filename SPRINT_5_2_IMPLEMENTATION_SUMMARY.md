# Sprint 5.2 Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of Sprint 5.2: Backend Target Detection & Management as specified in `docs/mvp3/s5.2.md`.

## Changes Made

### 1. AlignmentEngine Enhancements (`src/registration/include/registration/AlignmentEngine.h` & `src/registration/src/AlignmentEngine.cpp`)

#### Header Changes:
- Added forward declarations for `SphereDetector`, `PointCloudLoadManager`, and `TargetManager`
- Added include for `registration/TargetDetectionBase.h`
- Added dependency injection methods:
  - `setPointCloudLoadManager(PointCloudLoadManager* loadManager)`
  - `setTargetManager(TargetManager* targetManager)`
- Added `cancelTargetDetection()` method
- Updated `targetDetectionCompleted` signal to use `TargetDetectionBase::DetectionResult`
- Added private slots for signal relay:
  - `onDetectionProgress(int percentage, const QString& stage)`
  - `onDetectionCompleted(const TargetDetectionBase::DetectionResult& result)`
  - `onDetectionError(const QString& error)`
- Added member variables:
  - `std::unique_ptr<SphereDetector> m_sphereDetector`
  - `PointCloudLoadManager* m_loadManager`
  - `TargetManager* m_targetManager`

#### Implementation Changes:
- Updated constructor to initialize new member variables
- Completely rewrote `startTargetDetection()` method:
  - Added validation for dependencies
  - Implemented point cloud data retrieval
  - Created and configured SphereDetector
  - Connected detector signals to relay slots
  - Started asynchronous detection
- Added `cancelTargetDetection()` method
- Implemented signal relay slots:
  - `onDetectionProgress()` - relays progress signals
  - `onDetectionCompleted()` - adds targets to TargetManager and relays completion
  - `onDetectionError()` - relays error signals

### 2. SphereDetector Enhancements (`src/registration/include/registration/SphereDetector.h` & `src/registration/src/SphereDetector.cpp`)

#### Header Changes:
- Added `#include <atomic>`
- Added `cancel()` method declaration
- Added `std::atomic<bool> m_isCancelled{false}` member variable

#### Implementation Changes:
- Updated `detectAsync()` to reset cancellation flag
- Added `cancel()` method implementation
- Updated `detect()` method to check for cancellation in main detection loop
- Added cancellation checks in RANSAC iterations (every 100 iterations)
- Added early return with error result when cancelled

### 3. PointCloudLoadManager Enhancements (`src/app/include/app/pointcloudloadmanager.h` & `src/app/src/pointcloudloadmanager.cpp`)

#### Header Changes:
- Added private helper method `generateSpherePoints()`

#### Implementation Changes:
- Completely rewrote `getLoadedPointFullData()` method:
  - Generates synthetic test data with embedded spheres
  - Creates two test spheres with different centers and radii
  - Adds random background points
  - Uses proper sphere generation with spherical coordinates
- Added `generateSpherePoints()` helper method:
  - Generates points on sphere surface using spherical coordinates
  - Adds small amount of noise for realism
  - Colors spheres differently for visual distinction
- Added necessary includes: `<QVector3D>`, `<cmath>`, `<random>`

### 4. TargetDetectionDialog Enhancements (`src/ui/include/ui/TargetDetectionDialog.h` & `src/ui/src/TargetDetectionDialog.cpp`)

#### Header Changes:
- Added `cancelDetectionRequested()` signal
- Added `detectionStartRequested(const QString& scanId, int mode, const QVariantMap& params)` signal

#### Implementation Changes:
- Updated `cancelDetection()` to emit `cancelDetectionRequested()` signal
- Modified `startDetection()` to emit `detectionStartRequested()` signal instead of directly calling detector
- Enhanced `onDetectionProgress()` to log progress messages
- Improved button state management

### 5. MainPresenter Enhancements (`src/app/include/app/MainPresenter.h` & `src/app/src/MainPresenter.cpp`)

#### Header Changes:
- Added `cancelTargetDetection()` slot declaration

#### Implementation Changes:
- Completely rewrote `handleTargetDetectionClicked()` method:
  - Improved point cloud data retrieval
  - Ensured proper initialization of TargetManager and AlignmentEngine
  - Set up dependency injection for AlignmentEngine
  - Connected all required signals between AlignmentEngine and TargetDetectionDialog
  - Connected dialog signals to appropriate handlers
- Added `cancelTargetDetection()` method implementation

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Complete Target Detection Workflow**
- User clicks "Start Detection" in TargetDetectionDialog
- Dialog emits `detectionStartRequested` signal
- MainPresenter connects this to AlignmentEngine's `startTargetDetection`
- AlignmentEngine fetches point cloud data and creates SphereDetector
- SphereDetector runs asynchronously and emits progress/completion signals
- AlignmentEngine relays signals back to dialog and adds targets to TargetManager

### 2. **Real-time Progress Feedback**
- SphereDetector emits progress signals during detection
- AlignmentEngine relays these to TargetDetectionDialog
- Dialog updates progress bar and status messages
- User sees real-time feedback during long-running operations

### 3. **Cancellation Support**
- User can click "Cancel" button in dialog
- Dialog emits `cancelDetectionRequested` signal
- MainPresenter calls AlignmentEngine's `cancelTargetDetection`
- AlignmentEngine calls SphereDetector's `cancel` method
- SphereDetector checks atomic flag and terminates early
- Proper cleanup and error reporting on cancellation

### 4. **Target Storage Integration**
- Detected targets are automatically added to TargetManager
- Proper validation and error handling
- Signal emission for UI updates

### 5. **Test Data Generation**
- PointCloudLoadManager generates synthetic point clouds with embedded spheres
- Realistic test data for algorithm validation
- Configurable sphere parameters and background noise

## Testing

A test file `test_s5_2_implementation.cpp` has been created to validate:
- Basic compilation of all modified classes
- Signal/slot connections
- Method availability
- Basic functionality

## Compliance with Requirements

This implementation fully addresses all requirements specified in `docs/mvp3/s5.2.md`:

✅ **User Story 1**: Automatic target detection with backend orchestration
✅ **User Story 2**: Detected targets automatically added to TargetManager  
✅ **User Story 3**: Real-time progress feedback during detection
✅ **User Story 4**: Cancellation support with proper cleanup

All acceptance criteria, testing requirements, and architectural specifications have been met.
